"2" "What is special about Kweschn is that it helps me come out of my shell and share my English poems … I must confess that I have always wanted to express myself in English, but I never thought I would. And writing poems in English, you must be kidding! The fact that English isn’t my mother tongue is the biggest source of my insecurity. I still don’t feel as comfortable in writing in English as I feel in writing in Amharic. Both Amharic and English are beautiful languages to write poetry with, both are unique, and there are culture-specific words in each language that are so difficult to translate, so I sometimes prefer to just write with whichever I feel most comfortable with."

"12" "You have to get it into your system, babe: your expectations on relationships are not necessarily meeting the guy’s expectations.

On Thursday, as they head to Greenwaters Park to set up camp and get oriented, they find themselves becoming hungry and thirsty. Fortunately, there is a nearby pub that offers solutions to both. And even more fortunately, as we are sponsors of the event, each rider, guide and industry personnel gets a ticket for a free pint of our ale. There IS such a thing as free beer. It's obviously the first introduction to some to the goodness that is real ale, so a brief explanation is often required. I had one person come back up to the bar and yell \"this beer is warm\", to which I replied \"free, too\". He did manage to get through it anyway. That's the good news. The bad news that's also good news is that we're running out of beer again. The pumps certainly have been busy. A cask of Union Dew (as dispensed at the 2010 GBBF) was dispatched in two hours on Thursday, and the hoppy amber died shortly afterward. I now have to get back to brewing, as the brewery is full of empty casks that need washing and eventual filling."
"17" "As probably most authors do who self-publish, I downloaded a copy of my book to my e-reader. As I began to read, though, I started to notice little issues. I started to notice the missing word here or there, the spelling problems, the grammar issues."

"24" "But while we learn and develop, we don’t necessarily change our consciousness as we age. In fact, according to David Hawkins, most people’s vibrational level only changes by about 5 points during their lifetime if they do nothing to develop themselves emotionally and spiritually. This means that most people’s fundamental “home frequency,” the level of consciousness they return to from the peaks and valleys of life, remains set very close to where they were born."
"25" "4) Go back and clean up what you’ve written, add a catchy title and some headlines to break up the text, keep your paragraphs short, add some bullets or numbers to guide the eye. Maybe add references or a diagram. Step back and review what you’ve done. By now, you’ve got an article!"

"28" "Collapsonomics depresses me! I know that the world cannot continue in the way it is now and things must change, but to me collapsonomics isn’t very positive and is also very male dominated. I was discussing this with Vinay yesterday over coffee and he seemed to agree with where I was coming from which was so very refreshing for me as I have found myself in a dominated position in this environment for too long; that somehow my opinion for a future didn’t matter as the foundations for the future are being laid by men – Dark Mountain project was started by men, Truth and Beauty is run by men, and a lot of the movers and shakers are men. I have declared myself as a particularly rubbish feminist, but I don’t think feminism is my point here; it’s equality that is."

"33" "Then they handed me our boy. The boy I was certain would be named Noah or Benjamin. We looked at him and knew this was Luke. He came ON his Grandma Bolte's birthday! He was just over five pounds and the most miraculous thing I had ever seen. And to this day I look at that boy in awe."

"36" "This grey horse was the exception to the (first) rule. He is a young quarter horse stallion and a beauty to watch, he was also a perfect gentleman. Could show in the show arena with other horses and mares, and stand quietly in cross ties with other horses close by. I was most impressed by his white eyelashes and dark eyes, he stole my heart and I enjoyed watching his owner show him this year. And of course I had to have some pictures, in case I decided to paint him."

I hear the unmistakeable call of my first cuckoo of the year as the path continues to follow the river alongside more twisted willow pollards, eventually reaching Flatford Bridge, where Constable painted Flatford Mill (Scene on a navigable river). Crossing the river again brings me to Bridge Cottage, sitting snugly beneath its thatched roof. In the garden, a dry dock, the setting for Boat-building near Flatford Mill, painted in 1815."

I may have mentioned before that he played rugby with my brother, so I pretty much knew he'd be there, and had prepared myself. Funny thing is, he actually PLAYED on the team, and I didn't of course, but everyone preferred to hang out with me at the bar and took my side on the whole breakup. THAT's pretty damn cool if you ask me. He looked so out of place and uncomfortable, and Steph and I kept giggling about it all night. La-hooo, za-herrr."
"47" "Not that we are perfect parents by any stretch of the imagination, but I think we've done a pretty good job through trial and error of making the boundaries very consistent so that once it is bedtime, she has no excuses to get back up. We have a story before bed. We brush teeth before bed. Potty time happens before bed and there's no getting up for the potty after bed. (For the record, before reporting me to CPS for abuse and neglect in not allowing my daughter to urinate after she's tucked in and possibly causing her to have multiple and severe UTI's, she still wears a Pull-up to bed and she has NEVER. ONCE. ACTUALLY. PEED. when we have let her get up to use the toilet after bed.) We are very clear with her about that after this and this and this happen, then it's time for bed. No room for ifs, ands, or buts, and for the most part, she adheres to the confines of her bed when it is time, but not without her fair share of whining."

"49" "These kinds of machines which promise ultimate power at low, low prices are still a recurrent phenomenon, and make for pretty big business. Perhaps it’s not surprising that people regularly claim to have invented or discovered some device, mechanism, or physical process which would render that whole fossil fuel problem moot. It’s an appealing notion, to have something which could power itself and let you siphon off the overflow, storing and using all this new energy as it spills out from… somewhere. Unfortunately – at least, if you’re living under Homer Simpson’s roof and obey the laws of thermodynamics – the Universe places an inconvenient embargo on the whole idea."

"55" "I like it best when a detective is a flawed man, like my poor, alcoholic Semerket, so that in addition to solving the mystery at hand he must also solve part of the mystery within himself. Like the protagonists in Martin Cruz Smith novels, they also become the seat of moral authority. All around them are crimes, official corruption, and indifference, but they remain committed to the truth, regardless of how unpleasant it is. No matter how dark or dismal they are, they become heroic in the process – and your readers root for their success."

And I continue to maintain this point despite an increasing number of claims that Whitehead and Latour do no such thing. I’m willing to keep fighting this battle, but I really don’t see how the point can be avoided. Both of them not only reduce entities to their relations, but do so quite proudly and explicitly. Indeed, both of them consider this to be among their own major innovations."
"59" "Unhappiness about the direction of New Labour surfaced again yesterday in reports that key shadow ministers, like Robin Cook and David Blunkett, have attended meetings at the Commons of a group called What’s Left.

"65" "I still don’t have any friends among my peers but I do conversate with them more. The thing is I wanna say this had a happy ending but it doesn’t. I will never be the same after all they did. I am still paranoid after hearing even friends talk about me behind my back, after hearing people lie to me. I just now finished my freshman year of High school. I know their still 3 years I got. I contemplated suicide at 8! No child should even have to fathom ending it. I would come home crying and tell my mom. She just told me to beat them up. But I couldn’t. I’m not that person. I can only be aggressive towards people I’m close with. I help people who hurt me. You threaten me and I’ll help you with your homework. That’s me."

As I no doubtably have said before, I want to work for a specific ambulance company. (The fire department would be my dream employer, but I can make some compromises). The ambulance company I want to work for has the municipal contract and that means that if the call is BLS (basic life support -meaning the ambulance needs only EMT-B level providers), often times the fire department will have them do the transport of patients. If the call is ALS (advanced life support -for more threatening cases meaning at least one paramedic, aka EMT-P will be providers), but in that case, only if the City Fire Department doesn't feel they have the resources or time to do it, or so it seems."

"81" "If you are operating a home business, efficiency is one of the secrets to success. When you run your own business from home and you’re a one-person team, you’ve got lots of tasks that you need to execute yourself. From time to time, however, when you get to do those tasks is dictated by the needs of your business. So occasionally, you will find that business is slow and there are times when business is so frenzied you can hardly keep up. When business is slow, it’s important that you utilize those down times productively."

Pull up your damn pants, guys. Yesterday in our local Lab Corp, I had the extreme privilege of viewing someone’s red underpants while he stood in front of where I was sitting. His pants were way down beyond where no pants should go in public and the others in the waiting room were all looking at each other as if to ask, “why?”"

"86" "St. Augustine taught: “It is so much the essence of sin to be voluntary, that if not voluntary, it is not sin.”"
"87" "When I began my prep school teaching career in the autumn of 1973, the Vietnam War was not quite history: What President Nixon and Secretary of State Kissinger hailed as “peace with honor” had taken hold, most American troops had left Vietnam, and, thanks to Nixon’s policy of “Vietnamization,” only the Vietnamese were dying; but the war was not yet over. So, I didn’t worry about teaching the war as history, nor could I if I had wanted to. After five years in graduate school, I was convinced that only with the perspective provided by the passage of time could a “good historian” hope to approach such a controversial issue with “objectivity.” Moreover, I wasn’t particularly interested in modern American history, since most of my time in grad school had been spent immersed in the politics of late 18th- and early 19th- century Georgia."
"88" "Whenever I'm feeling a bit lethargic or plain down I will reach for my copy of Rainbow Rising (1976) by Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, turn the volume up to eleven (thanks, Nigel!) and get down to 'A Light In The Black'. Featuring Ronnie James Dio on vocals and Cozy Powell on drums, this is from Blackers' second Rainbow album and marks a high point in the history of heavy rock. When I hear the pounding drums, otherworldly guitar and ace synth solo I am transported to a world of youthful energy and dreams. It's just fabulous. I was a massive Rainbow fan in '76 but this came out just as punk rock was about to change our lives forever, thus seeming to consign this music to the bargain bin of history. It took me many years to even admit to myself that I still adored this stuff but now I fly the flag high for The Man In Black and his band of merry men. This music will be forever uncool in the minds of the eternally 'hip' - their loss. Go on, give it a go."

His only possessions were a toothbrush and toothpaste, some money, and the clothes on his back. He was to only stay one day, but decided to stay a little longer. He wrote on the hotel registry that he was from Meridian, Idaho with an address that belonged to a Best Western. He may be from my country (Canada), because he may have had a “slight Canadian accent” or an accent that sounds close."

The potato mustn't touch the stew, beans on the left, fish fingers on the right etc. The ketchup (compulsory with all meals apart from the bowl of cereal in the morning and I fear it is only a matter of days before he demands it there too) has to be pooled neatly in the exact spot on the plate he indicates or all hell breaks loose. I swear a mad dictator could not be more demanding or persnickety. In a bid to allow him some sense of self - going on the premise that this flip in his behaviour is a developmental stage - please, please let it be so - I'm going along with some of this.

"106" "I’ve always loved cartoons, ever since I was a kid and my parents subscribed to The Eagle for me – and I still think of Dan Dare when an RAF jet screams over our house on a NATO exercise. From early in my childhood – and certainly in the 1950s – I grew to love Giles cartoons and every Christmas one would appear under the tree, with my name in it. Today I still have a complete run of almost every Giles album, including the first one, which covers the latter years of the Second World War. Those early collections are very heavily thumbed and two or three are even missing their brightly coloured covers. So it’s not a collector’s collection, but then I’m a cartoon lover, not a nerd."

First, we have the depressed category and secondly we have the arrogant category. Both categories are committing the same exact sin. They both are worshiping their religious performance. They are either beating themselves up for their badness (depression) or else patting themselves on the back for their goodness (arrogance). In both cases, the focus is themselves. They live “in the name of Jesus” and yet live for nothing more than trying to get it right. Striving and striving and endless striving."

Sadly my darling bartender had the night off, so I had to drink my water alone in his honor. Oh the gossip - the gossip was dished, and crazy enough that is what helped me get this big weight off my shoulders! (Dirty little secret no more!) And best of all - I wasn't even there to participate in it. I was down the bar talking to a charming fellow instead. Yep. So things are turning around! I shed not a single tear today. I smiled all day instead! Halle-freaking-lujah!!"

If this embassy closure is a pretext to evacuate personnel in preparation for a mass terror attack against Tokyo, there will be unfathomable consequences for the Western ruling oligarchs and their extended families. In addition, nuclear weapons have already been placed in both Jerusalem and Rome by gnostic agents and these two cities will vanish forever if Tokyo is attacked. We urge all citizens of these two cities to evacuate immediately should Tokyo be terrorized by the Romans. Furthermore, the Chinese and Japanese military have finalized preparations to sink the La Palma rock formation into the ocean and cause a 100 meter tsunami to hit the US East coast and Southern Europe in retaliation for the planned attack on Tokyo. The world will no longer tolerate Roman terror. The Romans must renounce Satan and the Vatican must be purged of all Satanists."

"163" "The Oxford dictionary defines a Christian as “a person who believes in the Christian religion“. The Wycliffe Bible dictionary defines a Christian as “one who belongs or is devoted to Christ”. Being a Christian is not just understanding certain doctrines and spiritual principles, but it is having our life in Christ Jesus. It is walking in the Spirit of Truth. The Truth here “is a property of that judgment which coincides with the mind of God”. So it will not be wrong to say that “a Christian is one whose walk is in agreement with the mind of Christ concerning every areas of his or her life 1Cor2:16. That means a Christian is one whose character and conduct reflects the character and conduct of the Risen Lord Jesus Christ”. If your walk is contrary to the Mind of Christ concerning your life; and your character and conduct does not reflect Christ, then you are not a Christian even if you claim to be one."

The publisher is a laid-back sweetie and occasionally joins in the discussion on Facebook and twitter about the progress of #thosevampires (they have their own hashtag). But I would not make the central premise public at this point as that is risking not only my investment in the idea but the publisher's investment - and that's not fair. Plenty of people know that book 2 involves a nasty scene in Paris with a guillotine.

I am keeping to my exercise routine, hopefully as well as my diet. Through calorie counting I have discovered how much fat are in simple things and have been so shocked! I have recently been using flora cuisine for cooking rather than olive oil, to find it still has 10g of fat per tbls! It’s absolutely shocking. However I am keeping everything in moderation, and only snacking ever on fruit. I still have not broken my trend of no chocolate, chips, and cheese. Cheese has definitely been the hardest, I absolutely love cheese. However having not had it, I haven’t actually missed it that much and it makes such a difference in calorific value of sandwiches. Even chocolate I haven’t missed that much, which I think is mainly do to my thinking towards food now.

The pole itself is said to be used by the patient to hold onto and it had a cap on it that represented the container for holding leeches and catching blood.

An influenza virus probably caused die death of at least 450 harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) along die New England coast of the United States in 1979-1980. The family of viruses that is most often associated widi disease-induced die-offs, however, is the morbilliviruses. Measles is the most familiar virus in this family. Canine distemper virus (probably contracted from domestic dogs or farmed mink) caused the death of several thousand Baikal seals (Pusa sibirica) in the Russian Federation in 1987-1988. The closely related phocine distemper virus caused the death of 18,000 harbor seals in the North Sea during 1988, and a dolphin morbillivirus caused the death of several thousand striped dolphins (Stenella coendeoalba) in the Mediterranean Sea between 1990 and 1992. The death of more than 740 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops tnmcatus) along the Atlantic coast of die United States in 1987 was initially attributed to poisoning by algal toxins (see later), but more recent evidence suggests that this was also caused by dolphin morbillivirus. Morbilliviruses tend to suppress dieir host’s immune system, thus increasing the risk of secondary infection by a wide range of disease agents. These secondary infections are often the final cause of death for an individual infected with a morbillivirus, which can make it difficult to diagnose the real cause of a die-off."

I had eaten dinner to pass the time and spoke to a few friends within the hospital. My thoughts had begun to narrow down the path of how many hours were left in my 12 hour shift and how long until I'm back home with my family."
"257" "The latest volley from Norwich art-punks Fever Fever dials back the intensity for an overall more restrained affair.

A short while ago, I heard a tremendous crash and wondered aloud if they had dropped one of the trees on the house. But no, it fell beside the house. It was just VERY LARGE. Anyway, I keep glancing out, expecting to see one of these guys fall from a tree. They climb into the uppermost branches and hook themselves on with some manner of safety belt. Of course, when they are moving from limb to limb, they are not in the safety harness. You couldn't pay me to go up and do what they are doing. Since they wield chain-saws, I'm not about to let the boys go outside either."

You have to watch your health and your strength. There's a grip meter which gradually diminishes while you're holding on to things, and if it runs out you'll fall.

(You may remember the February 2010 standoff between Amazon and Macmillan, in which Amazon turned off Macmillan's buy buttons in protest of the agency model, but later capitulated and turned them back on.) As a result, the lawsuit alleges, consumers have paid tens of millions of dollars more for ebooks than they otherwise would have."

"292" "Obviously, due to the length of the book, there is not a lot of time for character development , but this is a story which is plot driven, rather than character driven. The disintegration of normal family life is easy to imagine and well portrayed from the point of view of the youngest son. The writing flowed very easily, and I was never bored.

It was rather funny, by the time we got to the last leg of our commute, it was so obvious that the great majority of people on the train with us were also heading to the same punk concert we were! When we got there, the opening band, The Riverboat Gamblers, were about halfway through their set, so we watched them for a while. They were pretty good! However, it was raining pretty hard at the start, so even though I had a raincoat on, I still got pretty wet. Wet, but not cold, so I was still quite cheerful. :-) Next came Rancid. They're good! I'd only ever heard a few of their songs, so I didn't enjoy them as much as I could have, but I really want to hear more of their music now..."

On this day, I mean early evening, I see people walk by, certainly not in any rush, but all seem to just stroll on by. Couples walking hand in hand, a child running along a few feet behind.

Surely they must realise that many schools in this country will be using this programme for educational purposes!

The posting process for Blogspot is infinitely easier and faster than WordPress, in my modest opinion.

The 20th Connecticut Regiment monument on Culps’ Hill at Gettysburg was dedicated in 1885, 20 years after the close of the Civil War.

"457" "The room was warm and dry and we were grateful for that. My aunt fell asleep instantly. I did not. The rain came down so hard I began to envision the mud outside collapsing in on us here in the forgotten room. Suddenly the Agnus Dei began to resound in my brain like a torment. “Lamb of God, you take away the sin of the world, have mercy on us.” It was strange because there was no Agnus Dei sung in the services, nor was it a part of the contemporary service I attended back home. I’m not even sure how I was so certain it was called the Agnus Dei. “Lamb of God…” I had to pee. Again. Slipping out of my sleeping bag, I squatted down on the floor with the cup, tried not to wake my aunt, tried to imagine meeting this need with a roomful of strangers. Felt the shame of bodily needs “….have mercy on us.” How spoiled we are with our indoor plumbing and our creature comforts of every kind. I began to imagine all the people, the women, who squat like this in mud and cold, in mud and heat, swatting flies with a baby on one breast and children all around, clamoring for more of something, each with their needs, their bodily needs, one spilling into the next til illness comes. “Lamb of God, you take away the sin of the world…” I was beginning to think I would not find peace here at all. And then I saw it, that orange glowing altar, and the Agnus Dei now refraining like a choir of angels and the certain knowledge that the only way to keep seeing that altar was to serve the poor. Was this how a person began down the path that would lead to a life like Mother Teresa’s I wondered as I wrestled and flopped, “…have mercy on us.”…until finally the light broke through the sliver of window and I heard my aunt’s voice."

"471" "In both cases, the monks subscribe to the same religion, the same order, and the same, strict, sub-order. They are monks, which means that even within the Church they have a particular orientation toward religious practice. And yet they have chosen nearly opposed models for the way the breweries will serve their missions. I realize I've wandered from beer here--it's the old religious studies major in me--but I find this fascinating. Trappist monks are a severe lot--they have chosen to remove themselves from society in order to focus on their relationship to God. Their order demands strict adherence to rules that are nearly 1500 years old and enforce the circumstances to support and protect this mission. Beer, on the other hand, is the most worldly of beverages. It's a social drink, a drink of the masses, a drink more than any other of the world. The reasons it made sense to brew in 850 AD are not so relevant now. (They don't grow their own barley, malt it, or need beer as a safe alternative to deadly water.) Yet here they are, brewing beer."
"472" "In the season's final two episodes, Will's investigation dovetails with the team's pursuit of a terrorist named Kateb, who is planning an attack on US soil. There are some very bold choices in these episodes--doubly so, as they both frustrate viewers' expectations from this kind of story, and clearly demonstrate the writers' belief that, despite its terrible ratings, Rubicon would be granted a second season. Even if the renewal had happened, I'm not sure I would have said that the season ends well--reintroducing Will into the office storyline allows him to take over it, and overshadow the more developed characters, and the season doesn't so much end as stop--so for all the praise I've heaped on Rubicon, I can't offer it any but the most qualified recommendation. I'd like it to be watched, and not just by television writers eager to embrace the fashion for 'realism' who maybe need a few pointers in how to do it well. There are characters here, like Kale, Grant, Miles, and Tanya, who I would have loved to spend more time with and that I'd like other people to get to know (if only because the actors, Howard and Roberts in particular, deserve recognition for their work). I can't feel too sorry for Rubicon as it aired, but I do regret the show that might have been, the workplace drama about people with an unusual, challenging, important job who are not always the superheroes they need to be to do it well."

"481" "5) Finally, least important possibly, overall, but nevertheless, don't be \"Tactical Timmy.\" When an instructor shows up to try and teach you something of value, there will presumably, be aspects of the information that you've read about. That's cool. In fact, it can even be helpful. You may have seen some of the information in other classes. That can be helpful too. However, if you feel the need to interrupt the instructor to tell him, or the class, the information he is getting ready to teach, it's not helpful. I can generally overlook it occasionally, but it is detrimental when the rest of the class is being distracted by the interruptions. If you think you are \"testing\" the instructor, you're not. Either we know our material, or we don't, and I don't know many instructors who will try and teach a class on information they don't know. If we know the material, you trying to fluster us is more obnoxious than anything. If your instructor is qualified to teach combat marksmanship, small-unit tactics, or other small-unit tactical information, he's probably not going to get real flustered by you tossing out interruptions."

When sewing your button onto the top flap you will want to sew it securely, tie it off and then rather than clip your remaining thread, sew back through to the outside of your envelope and tie a knot around the base of your button, then leave the remaining string so you can fasten your envelope shut."

Nor am I happy with the way the sport is going about its attempt to change it – but that’s for a different discussion, one that I will have in the very near future. Whatever system is in place however, needs to have buy in from all concerned – athletes, coaches, media and fans – because perception is reality to the masses whether it is reality or not. And currently the perception of track and field is that tremendous performances are the result of outside forces as much as they are from good old fashioned hard work – because too many athletes that have had great performances have been found to have supplemented that hard work with something else!"

For he does not fight from necessity or to protect his land in peace, as the right kind of a ruler does, but like a pirate or highwayman, he seeks to rob and damage other lands, who are doing and have done nothing to him.

But it goes deeper than that surely? Or did I genuinely have such an unrealistic view of the one that my failed relationships of the past were such failures because of my thinking that these people I had been involved with were truly not the one; that they did not fit into my own personal definition? In fact, that then got me thinking that if some of us have rather elaborate and romantic views of the one; are we destined to be alone forever? Or is there such thing as magic and that the modern view of the one is just a definition born to those who don’t believe in what true love is?"

We seem to be very busy here at the moment. Partly of our own choice and partly because that is what life is throwing at us at the moment. I would LOVE to be a totally proactive person. Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to instantly come up with solutions for everything that life hurls at you on the run while you are formulating a plan to get the best possible outcome from said situation? I tend to be the quivering wreck in the corner not coping very well at all thanks to my tendency towards reactivity rather than proactivity. I didn’t think you had a choice…I thought people were born proactive, or reactive but I am starting to see that it’s all choice. I am choosing to expose myself to all sorts of interesting premises at the moment. I am checking out world issues that are pertinent to who we are and how we choose to live. It’s very interesting to realise that the world doesn’t revolve around you and that you are only one tiny ant in the massive great nest we call Earth. It’s not only humbling but somewhat terrifying as well when you realise what a very small voice each individual has. That’s where we need community and like-minded groups of people. One person has a small voice that can usually be ignored. An entire community all chanting the same chant are quite a lot harder to ignore and social media allow us to be more aware of events and situations as they occur and allow us to lend our personal voice to our chosen causes. It’s no longer that easy to pull the wool over people’s eyes. If anything, it certainly allows you to open your eyes to all sorts of situations that you may never have been aware of. As a quintessential magpie I like to learn things and social causes are something that appeal to me."

Since most of our friends and family at the time were products of traditional parenting, most of the advice we received was in-line with the common views of the time. We were told all about the benefits of circumcision, and cribs, and the importance of babies crying it out, and how to choose a day care provider so Ginger could go back to work. It was easy to listen to that advice, nod politely, say \"thank you\", and then reject it out of hand. There were other tidbits of wisdom, however, which were a bit more difficult to simply dismiss, because I simply could not understand where they were coming from. These ideas were less about what to do and how to do it, and more about what to feel and how to feel it. I have always rejected the notion that someone else could tell me how to feel about something, and this was no exception."

I don’t have an issue with her but acting i snot something that is needed in this film because there is no plot. There is no point to it. The first part of the movie follows her when she gets married. Nothing happens there. She takes a bath, she’s late all the time, she has an affair with another man, her mother is a psycho. That’s about it. In the second part, she’s moved in with her sister in a big estate, her sister has a breakdown, and the world looks as if it will come to an end. Nothing happens there either.

God knows I don't feel like a fully capable adult, but that shouldn't diminish the fact that I am also a woman.

This negative thinking is quickly squashed by the revelation that I am exactly who I want to be. I am openly bisexual. Living a life I love. Even now, in a serious gay relationship, (for the sake of brevity “gay” is a term you will hear me sometimes use) I will not let go of my bisexual identity because to me it is very important to call into question the suffocating boxes we desire to live in.

Thence is that long-suffering, whereby “He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good.” Are not “His compassions over all His works, who sendeth rain upon the just and upon the unjust”? In His long-suffering He waiteth for the sinner, saying, “Turn ye to Me, and I will turn to you.” Are not “His compassions over all His works”? And when He saith, “Go ye into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,” this is not His compassion, but His severity. His compassion is given to His works: His severity is not over His works, but over thy works. Lastly, if thou remove thine own evil works, and there remain in thee nought but His work, His compassion will not leave thee: but if thou leavest not thy works, there will be severity over thy works, not over His works."

When I found an index card tucked in the pages with my name and a sequence of numbers on it, I realized with glee that it was my 7th grade locker combination. I loved every minute re-reading the story of Francie and her family. Pretty much all of my reading happens in one of two places: on the train to and from work, or in bed. Sometimes, I get a little self-conscious after being completely absorbed in a book on a crowded train—I can only imagine the faces I must have been making as, teary eyed, I read the scene where Francie's mother shoots the man attempting to attack Francie in the stairwell. When I realized I was at my stop, I shoved the book in my bag and noticed some middle-aged guy was giving me a similar look to the ones I give the people shouting nonsensically in public.

"880" "A stay or retention bonus is a simple concept and is commonly used during mergers or acquisitions of large companies. However, they are also applicable in the small family owned business arena as the impact of key employee loss or turnover can have a devastating effect on the business. In the small business context, the stay bonus is simply a contractual agreement between the business and select key employees that the company will pay a bonus if the employees stay for a period of time after a triggering event such as the retirement, death or disability of the business owner. By having the promise of a bonus at the end of the retention period, key employees may be more likely to remain with the company during transition, which may make the difference between future success and failure particularly if the transition was unplanned such as on the owner’s untimely death."

Some are even so crazy as to say that it is not proper for Christians to bear the temporal sword or to be rulers; also because our German people are such a wild and uncivilized folk that there are some who want the Turk to come and rule. All the blame for this wicked error among the people is laid on Luther and must be called “the fruit of my Gospel,” just as I must bear the blame for the rebellion, and for everything bad that happens anywhere in the world."

Stillman didn't know anyone named Smith or Wolenski, instead he got the names out of a phonebook. LeRoy faired well in the city for decades, boasting such regulars as Cary Grant, Barbara Streisand and Warren Beatty, but didn't have much luck in other cities. A second Maxwell's Plum opened in San Francisco in 1981 at a cost of $7 million but soon closed. His Potomac Restaurant in Washington, DC, the largest in the city's history, opened at a cost of $9 million but closed shortly thereafter. As much as LeRoy tried, he was never able to duplicate the popularity and glamour that his bar/restaurant on 64th and 1st enjoyed throughout the '60s and '70s. The restaurant's ultimate demise came in the '80s, when its food-to-value ratio deteriorated. An average dinner, once around $10 had shot up to around $40-$50. As newer fashionable singles' spots were shooting up all over the city, snatching up many of LeRoy's customers, the restaurant struggled to regain its food image. In the process the menu veered all over, from continental, French, Californian, and American, to a confusing blend of all of these. The iconic bar/restaurant, once a niche in and of itself, was long past its prime in July 1988 and abruptly closed."

He said he was looking for meatier games and so Rob showed him games like Coffee and Tortuga and all I could show him was Akrotiri. He really seemed to like Akrotiri, but understood that it was with another publisher. But again, it’s good to have a ‘line-up’ of publishers willing to look at our games! We went to lunch together and had another casual time with a publisher!"

The label says it is safe to use inside (with lots of ventilation), but I took advantage of the 70 degree weather we had yesterday and did it in the garage. Even with all the ventilation, the citris smell was pretty strong. From my label reading at Home Depot, it has low VOCs compared to other str*ppers, so it is fairly safe to use."

Indeed, according to Prof. Goulson, who headed the research, the team affectively worked on the project in their own time. The research by Stirling showed that bees that were exposed to certain pesticides produced 85% less Queen bees. As Queen bees are the only bees that can survive through the winter such dramatic reductions are a major cause of concern not just for the survival of bees as a species but also poses a significant problem with regard to the pollination of certain crops that we are dependent on. Indeed, the loss of nature’s most effective pollinator could be a serious blow to the agricultural sector, which worth £440 million to the UK economy."

"923" "In the years before “Dallas”, Larry Hagman was best known as the button-down astronaut who dreamed of Jeannie. But secretly he had a wild streak high and wide enough to land a 747 on. When he wasn’t toasting another sunrise with his next-door neighbor Keith Moon or dropping acid with David Crosby he was working hard to get this, his dream project, made. It’s a very strange, very loose sequel to the 1958 teen horror classic THE BLOB. The free-wheeling performances and absurdist humor are unlike any other movie we’ve ever seen. Hagman was obsessed with making this movie, often going without sleep for days on end, deeply worrying his friends and associates. Unfortunately the film was critically ignored upon release and Hagman retreated to the forest where he lived like an animal for several years before accepting the role of J.R. Ewing and returning to the forefront of American consciousness as the man you love to hate. More popular than ever, he was nonetheless a scorned and broken man whose one-of-a-kind film-making genius has never been fully appreciated. Until now. Join us for this very rare screening of Larry Hagman’s one and only film as a director, starring Robert Walker Jr., Burgess Meredith, Godfrey Cambridge, Marlene Clark, Gerrit Graham, and Shelly Berman.

In any case, he hunts and kills master criminals and leaves a red spider imprint on their foreheads. In later issues he'd wear a strange costume, but in this one he doesn't. Using all his wits (which he's pretty smug about; the man is a smirking smartypants) he gets out of a lot of tough scrapes to bring an evil master of disguise to justice, before he can unleash poison gas on Wall Street in a plot to rule the world. It's pure pulp but it's well-written and very entertaining."

Russia is an oil producer just like Saudi Arabia and they have shown great support to the Assad regime while not showing any support to other Arab countries. China also supports Assad, and both countries have vetoed UN resolutions against Syria while Europe is focused on the middle east to cover up their own economical problems and the US arent completely honest about their stand against Iran. So if you really think about it, the middle east is the center of a major war that will happen some time but the question is when it will actually happen."

I can still conjure the scent of antiseptic and urine that permeates institutional life.

There is also the reality that dreams created in movies still need to fulfill the requirements of the story, something I would not necessarily penalize the films for. The dreams in Lynch's \"Mulholland Drive\" are shaped just enough to work emotionally, while the dreams in his \"Inland Empire\" resulted in three hours of tedious and repetitious wankery that is not necessarily more believable as a dream. However, let us go one layer deeper for \"Inception\" to get at what bothers me about the film's central notion. Do our ideas always come from our dreams?"

"1030" "When Jesus cries out to the Father, saying “glorify your name” – it makes it clear that nothing we can possibly do can bring Glory to the Father – rather it is our submission to him that he uses to bring glory to his name. Consider all the hard work, all sweat and tears, all the discipline that has moved you closer to the goal set before you – as not truly giving Glory to God – unless you ask and submit it all to the Father. Even more difficult to imagine – the Father saying – not right now – the time is not right to bring Glory…. To let the King shine through you – you must be willing to be broken. Without brokenness – you have it all together and there are not cracks from which the light can shine. This is not a call to sin in order to create cracks – see Romans 6 – rather it calls us to embrace healing that begins with discovering our brokenness. It is this brokenness that most challenges our concept of advancement. We work so hard to do the very best we can – that it is quite contrary that it is brokenness which actually advances the Kingdom most clearly."

"1052" "When I worked at the Odeon, everything was done right. I was trained properly. Showmanship and presentation really mattered. At first it was a frightening thought that I would be involved in presenting films to a maximum crowd of 2200 people, but surprisingly enough I gained confidence very quickly and moved up from trainee, who would 'float' between two shifts, to being assistant to Leonard Himsley, the second projectionist. The chief projectionist was George Gorham. Among the first films shown when I first started were Hitchcock's \"Marnie\" and Wilder's \"Irma La Douce\". We took a pride with presentation back then. We had 'carbon-arc' lamps for the screen light source. It was a sin if we showed the bare screen, or showed the film temporarily 'out-of-frame'. We had an 'act-drop', as it was called, instead of traditional curtains. These curtains floated to the top of the stage, although they could be opened the normal way which we did for live shows. There was 2,284 seats in all and they were often filled. It was a wonderful atmosphere. Audiences generally knew how to behave and they respected each other and as a result made a much more enjoyable cinema going experience."

It is reasonably plausible in certain respects, and less so in others, but it is hoped that it will at least act as a springboard for further discussion."

I'm not sure if this is from swapping lenses with another Pet that may have been designed differently, or whatever, but it certainly doesn't screw into place. I'm told this is not uncommon. The only way to get the lens to stay in place is to get some electrical tape, cut it into a thin enough strip and wrap it around the lens once or twice, depending on how much space you need to fill. Then you just wedge it into the opening from the back until it looks straight."

Each person’s access to a variety of natural resources for personal survival, to say nothing of their role in the support and enhancement of what we are now pleased to call “life–styles,” is essential to both reproduction of labor power, and to maintenance of the mass consumption of commodities on which current capitalism depends.

I was just starting to come out of my thick shell of crippling shyness when suddenly, I had to spend 23 hours a day in a contraption that in no way allowed me to be a wallflower.

After weeks or months of having to fight with (or bribe) an assortment of surly maitre’d's for the right to sit down in a restaurant, sometimes you just want to get a fucking burger without resorting to conflict or extortion. And the cultural scene at Pushkin Square that fall was rather festive, really— a comical Soviet take on free-market economies.

It looks contemporary on the bar and recruits new people to the ale market. It's taken on by many pubs who are looking to trial cask for the first time. Anyone who met the previous owners will have got the impression that they were aggressively building the brand, attempting to turn it into a national cask ale brand as quickly as possible. It's only been going since 1994 and the original recipe was from a kit, so it's not as if there is any heritage here that's about to be trashed by a big corporate. There's no better brand for MC to acquire - mainstream, modern, little specialness to lose. With glorious hindsight, this is just the logical next step for Doom Bar's evolution."

As we have been pursuing our separate careers none of us had time to focus on the band, so nothing much happened until 2002 when I produced my second solo album “Oceans Of The Mind”. This gave me the push to contact Japanese promoters to set up a tour with the intention to promote Oceans. One thing lead to another and a complete show featuring Mario Millo Band and Sebastian Hardie was put in place. Prior to the concert tour of Japan, I organised a one off concert for both bands at The Metro Theatre in Sydney where the debut performance of Oceans Of The Mind was filmed (DVD due for release soon).

Books are not ‘messages’. They are about people – your characters – and what happens to them. The only way to make us care about your message is to make us care deeply about your characters, and paradoxically that means you, the writer, must care for your characters even more than you care for your beloved cause. Only in this way will there be even a chance of you writing another ‘Black Beauty’ or ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’. In a modern idiom, of course."

We have more guns than people in the US. Let me say this again. We have more guns than people in the US. Pick up any paper and read the news around the region – murder, suicide, murder, accidental shooting, murder, etc.- are reported consistently. For context purposes, there is high propensity of depression on college campuses and the NRA wants to arm the students. Arguments with family and friend escalate into a shooting because a hand gun was nearby. Yes, you are partially right NRA, “guns don’t kill people, people kill people. The last phrase should be “people who have access to guns kill people.” I like Chris Rock’s solution to gun violence – make the bullets cost $5,000. That will minimize gun deaths. As an US citizen, there is no reason a civilian should possess an AK-47. So, the real story is too many people are dying needlessly in our country. More guns to reduce the number of gun deaths would be like putting out a fire with kerosene."

So, next was to get hooked up to this holter monitor – it hooked onto my pants and had about 5 electrobes on my chest area. It recorded all of my heart activity. It sucked to sleep in (and carry around) but it was only for 24 hours. She also did some bloodwork as being anemic, dehydrated, or elevated sugars can cause similar symptoms. I was to drop the holter off today or tomorrow (will be tomorrow as work is just crazy and I’ve been at the doctors most of this week) and they will download the results, review it with the other stuff and my lab results, and we’ll know if there is anything to be concerned with or not.

The familiar pink elephant that is the mascot of the Delirium products sports a Santa hat and winter scarf on the label of this bottle - a nice touch, I thought.The pour was a cloudy and rich amber color, with a good thick head that showed some staying power. On closer inspection, there was some sediment swirling in the glass, a constant stream of bubbles running up the side."

He then returned to France, and married a wife in the city of Lyons. He has resided in this county for twenty-three or four years."

Coming to Spain I knew it would be impossible to stay gluten-free since a main component of the cuisine is bread. As our topic for our section of the blog, we chose to explore eating healthy in Seville. Through our projects we’ve focused on vegan eating most because many vegan restaurants and markets are very conscious of the nutritious content of foods.

Yes, adorable little tropical squirrels have taken up residence in our house. One day one was running industriously back and forth from a little hole high up the wall in our family room, along the rafters, through our bedroom and into our bathroom and presumably up to the attic. Gertrude Bell exclaimed, “Get me a ladder and I will climb up and catch it!” I sighed and hoped the thing wasn’t about to have babies in the wall. Last night after The International Man of Intrigue and I went to bed, we could hear the squirrel chirping in the attic. My big fear today is that the landlady’s henchmen have sealed up the openings to the outside without driving out our little friend. The last thing I need is a dead squirrel in the attic.

"1397" "Under the proposed MTA plan, the cost of an unlimited monthly Metrocard would increase nearly 17%, from $89 to $104. Riders would have the option of opting for a less expensive $99 card with a maximum number of trips limited to 90. The MTA has presented this proposal as progressive, noting the difference in income between riders who purchase the pay-per-ride Metrocards and the unlimited weekly cards, and those who purchase the 30-day pass. I would say that the board has a faulty understanding of wealth when they consider an individual making $63,000 annually in New York City comfortably able to afford a 17% fare hike. The monthly unlimited card has always been the most affordable option on a day-to-day basis; those who use public transportation daily and choose day-to-day or weekly Metrocards are clearly purchasing their cards with the money in their pocket. I agree that the MTA should keep the needs of New York’s working-class citizens primary in their consideration, but a truly progressive increase would not harshly punish the majority of middle-class New Yorkers."

And I think they're especially kind to help the Greeks especially with all the Greek protests/rallies/strikes going on showing their unwillingness to change their ways...(i know they have to help the Greeks given the need to sustain the Euro. Actually, this entire Greek crisis has shown the weaknesses of a common currency, the Euro.)"

This ratio has the convenient property of overstating the relationship between crime and the prison population. If violence declines, it affects both measures in a way that makes increases in imprisonment seem to be more important than they actually are. When violence declines, the blue line goes down, of course. But, since violence is the denominator of the red line, and a shrinking denominator makes a number bigger, the red line goes up by a similar proportion. Since Murray essentially counts violence multiple times, this approach guarantees that his argument that prison reduces crime is supported by the graphic regardless of what actually happens with imprisonment and violence. Beyond this deception, Roman argues that Murray's chart shows a troubling trend: declining economic returns on incarceration:"

We reviewed over 20 topics and unanimously choose this month to be the month to talk about going green and sustainability. I’m far from an expert on this topic so I decided to seek out someone who is. One of my readers is very active in alternative energy research, recycling, and conservation. He graciously invited me to his home for an interview. He gave me a tour, showed me a variety of environmentally safe products, and discussed with me his passion in the areas of sustainability. I left his home with some incredible information and some very valuable insight."

Good."

One theory suggests that the wizard may have run forward in some vain attempt to “rescue” or otherwise save his damsel, or possibly even sacrifice himself for her.) The dragon was happy to have two snacks before him and after a flight of ranged attacks towards him, including a savage arrow strike that did quadruple damage and tore open his throat, thanks to a critical hit card, the dragons turn came around again. Most of the characters were still stuck on the stairs."

Godard, early in his filmmaking career, may have made films that, on a certain level, expressed a certain yearning for life to be like a movie. But he knew, deep down, even literature, sound or image had limits on accessing the various human truths of a situation. The distance is always there, however much a medium tries to bring you the cold, hard facts."

"1597" "If you have a look at this photo that was taken and posted to flickr yesterday (full credit to be given to Richard for the photo) you can see the severity of the crack that's caused the bridge to remain closed for four months. It really is an absolute joke that the tiny bit of decay to the surface can cause the bridge to be closed when almost all of Fife's roads are in far worse condition. The southbound B940 through Pitscottie and over the bridge is in a far worse state than that with potholes and rough surfaces to destroy your car as you coast down to the crossroads."
"1598" "As a society, we have rightly adopted a harm reduction culture in which we seek to persuade people by law and reason to safeguard their health. Changes in the law have brought about restrictions on smoking and the forthcoming crackdown on alcohol will similarly save many lives. Healthy eating promotion is also playing its part (although the legal route may yet be needed in this respect). And police will stop and prosecute any motorist not wearing a seatbelt or motorcyclist without helmet."

We see each other on Skype but mostly he performs for me then and is silly; we don’t have deep philosophical conversations the way the others and I do and I can’t really know how he is. He speaks a little but is difficult to understand. Our communication had always been intuitive, on a heart level. I so wish I could see him more. I miss his hugs. Nathaniel and Serena look out for him and have taken over most of his care. Everyone agrees that he seems happy. I don’t know yet what his future looks like."

"1608" "I wouldn't say that Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon starts off innocently - far from it - but apart from some of the typical long takes and following shots, it lulls you into something of a disarmed state until about midway through, when certain scenes make it evident exactly who is behind the camera. Despite one storyline that is far sweeter, and seemingly genuinely so, than anything I've seen Haneke do in the past, the majority of the intertwined plot threads focus on the venal, vengeful, and quite probably evil nature of humanity. I like Haneke's films quite a lot, but it can be hard to leave the theater without wanting to lock yourself away for several days until some meager hope in humankind returns."

In a khaki pants pack, they moved as one and were up in Slappy's face before I could even blink an eye. In mere seconds, one of the mothers already had all the boys herded back over the grass and the other three Mothers had Slappy encircled. Animals are animals.

Just to clarify who Nanny was, she was my mother's grandmother...my great grandmother. To me, she was just Nanny. The woman who let me sleep with her in her full sized bed when I spent the night with her. She even made sure my pillow had my special pillow case on it. It was an old, vintage pillow case with ballerinas on it. It was lovely with fair dancers wearing soft pink tutus. She had a nightgown for me at her house that she made. As I grew, I guess she made new ones because I always had a nightgown at Nanny's house when I spent the night. Before bed, Nanny told me stories like Little Red Riding Hood and nursery rhymes like Little Boy Blue. LOL...I won a nursery rhyme contest at a baby shower once because of that!"

What role does his industry play in shaping that? 60 years of films such as Stanley Kramer’s The Defiant Ones and Guess Who’s Coming Dinner. 20 years of Freeman himself alternating playing either God or the President. All for naught. If Freeman is right, then Hollywood has failed in the role that his fellow progressives set out for it. And he has failed in his choices of film roles."

I play a lot of Chess. The violence implied in Chess isn't nearly as visceral as those in modern video games, and few would have any opposition to their kids playing more Chess, so a logical question to ask is whether or not the problem lies in the level of realism achieved in the gaming world.."

I felt I was just giving, giving, giving in every area of my life and that I was having the lifeblood sucked out of me. Everyone hits rock bottom in different ways and we all have different levels of tolerance and fortitude. And it is a sad truth that if you are one of life's givers, someone who just 'copes' and stoically gets on with things, then people just continue to take. Until finally you collapse under the strain. Mercifully I never took an axe to anyone's head, but I have come close to some alarmingly fierce moments of anger and potential loss of control. I also remember thinking about my girls and their tender years and innocence - that they had no idea what a terrible state their mother was actually in, barely able to get up in the morning to feed them breakfast. If there was anything which drove me to get better, to learn how to mend and what steps to take to make sure I never end up in that bad, bad place again, it was the desire to be a good mother to my girls. I didn't want them to remember me as a basket case, yet I wanted them to know me as a real human being - with weaknesses and imperfections - and to understand that life is not always easy or indeed does not always turn out as you might expect. Most of all I wanted to be there for them - totally present in mind and emotion, not just physically."

"1730" "Alright, before I leave you with the recipe, let me just share with you my experience with baking these tarts. I baked them in two batches, one on Monday & the other yesterday. I thought the pastry for the first batch was a bit too thick. Other than that, they were perfect. I only managed to take one picture of the first batch using my phone when it was just out of oven, before I left the house to run some errands. You may take a look at it on my Facebook Page. I also baked them at 200 deg C for about 25 minutes. For the second batch, the dough was a bit too thin so much so the custard for some shells seeped through even before I could put the tray into the oven. I also baked them at 200 deg C for the first 10 minutes & reduced it to 180 for the next 15 minutes. The tarts turned out to be more fragile than the ones from the first batch. A bit more baking time would be good... So the next time I make this tart, I'll make sure that I roll out the dough to a medium thickness & bake them at 200 dec C, just as recommended by Wendy. Do read Wendy's post where she shared some tips on the thickness of the shells."

I had already been eagerly anticipating a draft Bellhaven Twisted Thistle so that is what I got, but the beer selection was fantastic - everything from Ninkasi's fresh hop beer to a great cask offering (which escapes me at the moment). But what really caught my eye was an extensive list of Brew Dog beers. I suspect, though I didn't ask, that these are from the bottle. And they don't come cheap: a glass of Brew Dog will set you back $12! Still, if you want to see if all the fuss is due to genius at self-promotion or to great beer, here is your chance.

I’m not trying to make myself sound like I am. In fact, I have a lot I could be doing better as far as Mass goes. Ever since I gave Genevieve the Bible for her baptism day, I’ve been trying to read it with her a little bit before Mass, but as far as my own personal preparation… I’m not going to lie, I get lazy. And then there’s daily Mass, a habit that I have fallen out of in the past few years. I used to go a lot when I worked at the elementary school, because the church was right next door. That was almost 4 years ago though. Through much personal laziness and also a bit of irritation at the ever-changing Mass schedules due to re-forming the parishes in Nanticoke, I haven’t been to daily Mass very frequently. I wish that St. Mary’s here in WB had a morning Mass, but their daily Mass is at 12:10. They probably made it that time so working people like me could just walk over and attend Mass on their lunch break, unfortunately I haven’t been lucky enough in my last two jobs in WB to go to lunch at that time. St. Nick’s is right down the road, but their daily Mass is 6:30… even that half-hour difference between 6:30 and 7 is incredibly disheartening to a 24 year old who just wants to SLEEP as much as possible and wouldn’t crack an eyelid until noon if she could."

Afraid for her infant son, McKay's widow packs him up and moves to New York where, after her death, he's raised by her sister in ignorance of the feud. When he reaches the age of majority, Willie McKay (Buster Keaton), returns to the family home to reclaim the assets of his father's estate (if the run down house left by John McKay can be called an \"asset\"), and immediately enters the Canfield family crosshairs. He also, during the train journey from New York, falls in love with Virginia Canfield (Natalie Talmadge), who invites him over to her family's house for dinner. On his arrival at the home, Willie learns of the feud, but he also learns that the Canfield code of honor prevents any of the family from killing him so long as he's their guest. The solution, obviously, is for Willie to just never leave the house."

"1849" "The video stuff yesterday was awesome: if you were late, you missed the movie trailer for GENESIS. Then of course the \"siltent film\" about Jesus' death and resurrection! The staff were real gamers for dressing up and playing the part, our video guy Scott - great job."

"1856" "\"If you look at history, the one thing that's certian is that events are accelerating. Things are changing faster and faster, like a ball rolling down a mountain. Our idea is that if things continue to accelerate at this rate, eventually we'll reach overload, cataclysm. We want to provide the relevant soundtrack to this process. Our sound is like this immense cocktail, saturated with all these elements of past music jumbled up with the absolutely modern, like sampling and synthetics."
"1857" "Google is your friend, so find a recipe... any recipe... with that ingredient and make it. It could be something as easy as tofu or as unusual as smoked turkey legs. Think outside the box a bit and stop cooking the same old, same old!!!"
"1858" "Along with having LOTS of GREAT recipes...the book also has little helpful tidbits as well as really cute one-line sayings mixed in. I loved that aspect of the cookbook!!"

"1863" "It was only in the last year or so that I realised what it was after it turned up on a US compliation: Music Box Dancer by Frank Mills, a US Top Ten hit in 1979. It wasn't a hit here, but it's a tune we all know. Was it used in a TV series or something? Whatever, it always makes me feel rather emotional and I'm not sure why."

"1866" "In Your Dog Is Your Mirror, dog trainer Kevin Behan proposes a radical new model for understanding canine behavior: a dog’s behavior and emotion, indeed its very cognition, are driven by our emotion. The dog doesn’t respond to what the owner thinks, says, or does; it responds to what the owner feels. And in this way, dogs can actually put people back in touch with their own emotions. Behan demonstrates that dogs and humans are connected more profoundly than has ever been imagined — by heart — and that this approach to dog cognition can help us understand many of dogs’ most inscrutable behaviors. This groundbreaking, provocative book opens the door to a whole new understanding between species, and perhaps a whole new understanding of ourselves."
"1867" "I've had some questions about the word LOVE on the card. I cut them at 1\" high. I manually moved the blade on my Cricut to about where I thought I wanted the letters on my card (cut the card front larger than your finished piece - it is easier to cut off the excess afterwards than to position the blade exactly where you want it). I cut out the L and the O first, taking note of the positon of the blade given by the measurements on the screen. After cutting the L and O, I manually moved the blade back to the appropriate measurement so that the V would line up with the L, leaving about an 1/8\" between the bottom of the L and the top of the V. Cut out the V and E and then use the negative space."
"1868" "Randy Singer’s “The Last Plea Bargain” is a gripping story about the intricacies of the justice system and how far both defense attorneys and prosecutors will go for their clients and reputations. From the first page to the last, Singer never disappoints. As a veteran trial attorney, Singer has been called the Christian John Grisham. He was recently a finalist with John Grisham and Michael Connelly for the inaugural Harper Lee Prize for Legal Fiction sponsored by the University of Alabama School of Law and the ABA Journal.

"1871" "Under Obama, the United States has more drone capacity. However, the U.S. has only 7,000 aerial drones in its arsenal, and considering there are about 1.57 billion Muslims in the world, that is not nearly enough. Why hasn’t Obama ordered more. It’s because he’s coddling the enemy."
"1872" "Now I have some blog candy I'm giving away, (I probably throw some more goodies in there, I've been doing some cleaning, lol) all I ask is that you be a follower and please leave me a comment telling me what projects or things you would like to see me post! I kind of feel like I'm in a rut and maybe you all can spark my curiosity to new endeavors or give me some new ideas or trends that are out there that I'm not aware of. Thanks in advance and enjoy the hop!"
"1873" "People tell me I’m really good at marketing because I’ve been writing a blog for years but the truth is I was just a lonely housewife desperate to get published. The fact that I became totally enamoured with all the new technology is another story."

There wasn’t much relaxation. You didn’t even have time to eat. When you start in the morning and work until midnight – it gets to where you don’t have any personal life. You just exist!”"
"1879" "At 50 minutes past 4, with all the above looking distinctly unlikely, SURROUNDED by more photocopies than I ever want to see again and with my stress levels elevated to somewhere near Jupiter, I got a phone call. \"Hi lovely, how are you?\" For a clever man, Mr PBBB sometimes astonishes me. \"Anyway,\" he continued quickly, as he heard my large and dangerous intake of breath, \"I've got good news which you might think is also bad news but it really isn't.\" At this point, all bets about him winning ANYTHING writerly were off. \"What?\" I snapped. He replied \"The deadline's been put back til next Wednesday.\""
"1880" "When I was twelve, I read Pride and Prejudice for the first time. My mother, may she rest in peace, was a great reader, and like the character of Marti in Love Comes Softly, Peggie Jeffers was a firm believer that books held great adventures. Because of her model, I have always read voraciously. Therefore, Pride and Prejudice was just the latest in a long line of classic novels in my reading repertoire. Or so I thought at the time. Little did I know that this novel would speak to me of how personal conduct can be seen as a bridge between private moral order and social order."
"1881" "The past week and a half we all have been fighting a pretty nasty bug. It’s the ugly cough with your sinuses full of gunk kind of sickness. It is weird because we all started feeling sick while Spencer and I were in Hawaii and Preston was in Utah so we think we must have gotten it before we left. Good news is that we are on the mend. I thought I was getting a sinus infection so I called my Midwife and she suggested a neti pot. If you’ve never heard of that you should google it. Or maybe don't. But, I have to say it helped!"
"1882" "And another bento..."
"1883" "So thru some negotiating and tweeting with the good people over there, I was shipped a bottle of Penn 1681(along with a few other goodies, but those are for future blog posts). The bottle looks amazing! By far one of the most decorated and intriguing bottles Ive seen. Really stands out and would most definitely be an eye catcher on the back bar, or on the shelves of a liquor store. So on to the best part of a review... The TASTING!!!"
"1884" "“Well, the stuff that has become more commercial doesn’t have any edge.” – Iggy Pop"
"1885" "I rather liked the secondary characters. Finn is a womanizing tech wizard and as such wasn’t really original. However, the dwarf sisters were great. Sofia is a cook/cleaner of murder scenes and she dresses like a goth, and her sister JoJo is a healer, and a beauty salon owner."
"1886" "“On the day that thou shalt determine to make a movie, lo, the machinations of all the world shalt begin to conspire. The murmurs of the machinations shalt grow in volume and maleficence as the day of Rolling Cameras approaches, until they threaten to overwhelm all other things."

"1892" "All you need to start on your abundant ‘now’ is to take a minute and see the bigger picture. Whatever part of your life you are viewing in a scarcity mindset, zoom out for a while and see the bigger picture. If you are living in a lack of money life and feel that there is not enough to go around and you have been left out. Take another look at the bigger picture, there are Trillions and Trillions of dollars and pounds in the world and there is more than enough for everyone to share."
"1893" "First, there’s the media frenzy over the “Hollow Man,” a gutless corpse found on the beach. And yet people think it’s perfectly normal to find dead sharks in the middle of downtown boulevards—or to spot black mushroom clouds behind the airport. Then there are the roving bands of carjackers who suddenly find themselves inconvenienced. Not to mention people lurking outside sex-addiction meetings."
"1894" "I am a condiment fanatic especially when it comes to hot sauces and mustards. But store-bought condiments, if not careful, can add some pretty hefty calories to your meal. Some have a lot of added sugar or even worse corn syrup while others are laden with very unhealthy ingredients, additives, preservatives and taste boosters like evil MSG, so beware."

"1897" "The wonderful and wacky things that make us who we are don’t change when we pursue various interests in our life. While I consider myself a very social person, I don’t like having people around me when I’m working. And I’ve had sensitive ears since I was a small child, so voluntarily putting things in my ear canals…yeah, not so much. And the whole time crunch. No one has lots of time – we make time for the things that matter."
"1898" "Chamblee is the best big sister (aside from my own, of course). She is in a phase where she wants to help. And I mean, help with ev.ery.thing. It's very sweet and it's often funny. I love to hear her talking in the next room, \"I helping mama\". Only to find her unloading the trash can- just so she can put all the trash back in. Or to hear a giant squeal coming from the bouncy seat that Jake is sleeping in- and finding that she has yanked out his pacifier... just so she can give it back to him. \"I helping mama.\" She has the sweetest heart. She understands the concept of sharing already, kind of, and will steal a toy right out of your hand- just so she can give it right back and share it with you. I love that girl. And she loves her brother."

"1900" "I finally broke down and purchased the Creative Elements stamp set and I am sooooo glad I did. What a pretty set this is. I love the pattern on the butterfly and the way the flower stamps. Just beautiful. And my new favorite color combo Island Indigo and Pool Party. I am also adding this to the challenge folder on Latenightstampers--this week is a girly design--I don't think this would make a good masculine card, do you, lol!

Emma is totally paralyzed and unable to move any part of her body. She cannot speak and breaths with the aid of a small tube inserted through a tiny incision in her windpipe called a tracheotomy."
"1909" "Redpoint NOC-out Cover-up Compact. Like it. Three colors: a salmon, a beige and a yellow. I use the salmon corrector quite a bit. It's pigmented so a little goes a long way. The beige color is not my exact skin tone color. I've never used the yellow. I think you can get the salmon on it's own and would re-purchase that."

"1913" "The path continues through lacy cow parsley in a narrow tree belt flanked on either side by football and rugby pitches where what must be some of the last games of the season are under way. We cross Beverley Brook, a tributary entering the Thames at Barn Elms, and much improved in recent years, by means of a footbridge which provides the venue for a quick game of Pooh Sticks. A short walk across the sports ground brings us to the busy A3 at Robin Hood Roundabout, where the pedestrian crossing has a companion in the shape of an equestrian crossing complete with red and green horses!"

"1918" "Nelson Literary Agency? We hire an outside gun who has been doing reviews, audits, and lawsuits on royalty statements for 25 years."

"1925" "To Kendra, Lila and Mitzi, the doors all looked the same at the entrance to the hallway, until they passed each one and saw the various, schedules, notices, magazine articles and bumper stickers that were posted on them. They were all of a distinctively progressive bent, which comforted them."
"1926" "I had intended to walk down along the river, camera in hand, to take some photos of the beautifully ethereal atmosphere of the young leaves on the beech trees. However . . . someone (Miffy, the boys' mother) saw me going and decided she was going to come too, but she was complaining bitterly all the way until I turned round and retraced my steps. Here she is, yowling at me and telling me to Hurry Up! She is blind in one eye, but this doesn't seem to stop her hunting."
"1927" "Now we find that, as they are declining too, many people romanticise industrial communities in a similar way. But for all the Silver Jubilee street parties that were held in now empty roads, there was also often domestic violence, alcoholism, vicious bullying and repression that went on behind the net curtains. The uncomfortable fact is that feelings of community are to an extent always based on the adoption of a form of collective identity and the exclusion of that which is different."
"1928" "I was as worried about being coddled and I was about being hurt."
"1929" "i mean c'mon. it's all about papi really, right?"
"1930" "Because of this, the program has been able to attract world-class authors to its faculty, authors who are also experienced, accessible teachers.

"1931" "Because the sun has drawn near,"
"1932" "Why I don't ever want to hear it again - I've heard this used in a couple of situations. It was uttered many times when I was having chemotherapy. I think it is something people say just so they have something to say to you nicer than \"Dear God, You look like hell!\""
"1933" "My main beef with this rant from Shirley is that he uses the phrase bloggerati in a demeaning way, now I myself have used this phrase as just a name for a group of bloggers together(it's as good as any other description). The other beef with Shirley is that he's practically labelled us all as beer fashionista's who only chase 'the next beer'! What a pile of absolute tosh! Does anyone else think that Shirley is just slagging off that which he doesn't understand?"

Add more dressing if necessary. Place in a tall mound on a plate. Scoop out small chunks of burrata cheese and place all over the salad. Sprinkle with chopped herbs. Serve immediately. If the salad sits for a bit the beans will start to lose their vibrant green color but they'll still taste good."
"1936" "She said nothing so he continued \"If you want your garden to be interesting again, I can give you some ideas, but it'll be all the stuff you know already.

"1942" "Wow, today has been an incredible day. I guess I better start with last night to get to today... Last night at around 11:00 PM I went to my next door neighbor's house (she happens to be one of my very best friends) because she was having some landlord issues. Well needless to say, we were both upset and in horrible moods, but then the conversation shifted to spirituality and illness and the relation and honest to God, for a brief instant I felt no pain at all. I started crying because it was so foreign to me to have that feeling! It has been approx. 3 years since I have felt what it feels like to have zero pain. I couldn't believe it! We decided right then and there that we are going to be grateful for the blessings we have and we are going to be thankful for our trials and tribulations because without them, we wouldn't learn. We wouldn't grow as human beings... as spiritual beings. I was (I think I can speak for us both here) totally swept away with feelings of pure love and light and I could see her aura getting brighter and brighter by the minute. Normally I can't see aura's, but I could see my friend's! It was incredible."

"1944" "This is the Saturday of the Octave of Easter, a solemnity so great and central to our Catholic faith that Easter Day is celebrated for eight full days, and the Easter season is joyously observed as the Great 50 Days of Easter. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, Christ – risen from the grave – is in our midst. His Holy Word teaches us the truth. His Sacred Body and Blood becomes our food and drink."
"1945" "Trophy husband and I took a much needed weekend away last fall. We headed to the beach. By fall, all the summer crowd had returned to wherever they came from. We only had to deal with the snow-birds who were settled in and not bothering anybody."
"1946" "I hope that when we go to church on Sunday, we don’t try to hide or excuse away Nephi’s sin, to say it wasn’t really “that bad.” All he did was get angry at his enemies — but look how badly they treated him! All he did was feel weak under the pressure of his trials — but look how hard his trials were! He’s justified in the sin he hates so much. He’s still “righteous!” He’s still “worthy!”"
"1947" "This does not spread easily or quickly. All the promises are lies."
"1948" "First and foremost, my work with the labor party (lpp): The amazing thing about working with them was that I met communities - home based workers in Gadap, revolutionaries from Landhi, flood affectees from Sajawal, hard core union organizers who possess stamina for 8 hour meetings. The bad thing was that I was from this side of the bridge, and as an elite, I too often and unwittingly succumbed to the limitations of inter class collaboration. I was too often called to the pulpit, given respect I did not earn, asked to join the Congress. But when I demanded I do hands on work such as filing lawsuit for our comrades who were killed in a road traffic accident caused due to state neglect of roads and lack of hospitals near highways, I was shut down. Where my personal skills could be useful, these were ignored."

"1950" "Yesterday we girded up our loins, pulled on our walking shoes, and trotted off with the walking group. Everyone but us has bought a shirt in red and white with the appropriate logo in the appropriate place, but when one has lots of bright coloured tee shirts why not wear them? Especially when one does not look at all good in white. Wearing those dazzlingly glaring white shoes is enough for me. It was really hard work yesterday too, for some reason I didn't feel quite 100%. Perhaps 85%. After walking for 45 minutes it was more like 53%. Back up to 99% today. Walking is supposed to be very good exercise but I don't enjoy it.....all I can think of after we finish is \"that's an hour of my life I can never get back\"......it's like taking nasty-tasting medicine, we know it's probably doing us good but that doesn't mean we have to like it. Once a week is more than enough for me."
"1951" "I can recall at just about every position an instance where responses were crafted to mislead employees on some upcoming event – an office move, loss of a contract that resulted in layoffs, company being acquired, or a shift in corporate policy which affected employees. Of course, the justification was to prevent employees from being confused or misinterpreting events. Think about it, is there any more pompous condescending attitude?? In essence, it is the impression of senior management that the majority of employees are incapable of analytical thought and/or are too stupid to understand corporate strategy."

There is no reason to fear a Rapture or 2012 or any sort of apocalypse of supernatural nature because IT JUST WON'T HAPPEN. The same stuff has been predicted since the beginning of story telling. It gets people to listen, puts fear in them, sometimes this can make them easier to control. Any sensible person can usually see right through this kind of stuff, but there really are idiots out there that believe every 'prophecy' they hear."

"1958" "Cassandra was rather distressed by this sudden contact from her family, and more so at the conundrum of the newly arrived pair: Jory was affected by a magical geas to see his contract through, an arrangement he insisted was a voluntary one for the considerable pay he’d received. Daveth, in the meantime, was revealed to be a former pit fighter of some repute in Katapesh whom won his freedom and had since come bereft of such arcane assurances. After much debate, Cassandra accepted the arrivals and daunting mule train into the fortress before penning a reply to the letter she’d received from her parents–leaving no uncertainty as to her feelings on their continued avenues of trade."

I've been reading from the first books, Apples, which covers very basic maths, but I didn't want us to miss any of the fun bits and interesting tangents which make the series so appealing (Archimedes for example).

"1964" "Meanwhile, I am eagerly looking for the next great job with help from monster.com and lots of networking, but am excited about taking care of business around the house and giving attention to some things that really need it.

And things have certainly felt like they were moving quickly this week, as I have put a new project into place for work, including website and social media publicity."
"1975" "After all! Why should anyone care what you think? It’s not like you have any reason to care what they think. Why can’t they ignore you just like you like to ignore them? The answer is because your situations are different. Some people have to care what other people think. For some people, what other people think actually affects their ability to live their life in peace. To give one example, a cisgendered straight person really doesn’t need to worry about what LGBT people think of them, but if you think that LGBT people don’t have actual high-stakes reasons to care what cis straight people think of them, I don’t know what universe you are living in but I want to go to there."

"1990" "So thinking of the past can give both pleasant, humorous, sad, embarrassing and shameful memories. for example over the last 8 months i have been living far away from family and friends in Sydney and its pushed me through my last stages of choosing the self persecuting choices which led me astray towards a chaotic bipolar day to day living into this sense of independence and living happily content. It was during this time of chaos that my blog was practically a husk of what it used to be, and only written when I was on the happy side of this chaotic bipolar little slice of hell. To put it simply it was a series, well pretty much a pattern of “happy-disappointment-angry-upset-break up-apologies-false sense of happiness” for about 6 months. Yes if you’ve gathered so far I’m talking about my previous relationship, and now your probably thinking “why didn’t you end it sooner if you were so unhappy then?” well it wasn’t as easy that, I was both in denial and holding onto that last slither of hope that things would change, I’m not saying I wasn’t happy at all in this 6 month duration, but it was quenched and like a candle in the rain, it didn’t take long to go out."

This is the smallest consolidated piece of Hadrian’s Wall you will see, but it is far from the last. Now we must with all due caution cross the road and head uphill towards the site of Milecastle 7 (Benwell Bank). All the time the road is on the line of the ditch and the curtain wall approximates to the property boundaries fronting onto the pavement (which is roughly the line of the berm)."

He wants to try every sport out there, and he wants to excel at every sport out there. He is ultra competitive. He does not like losing. Losing, or even less than great performance, results in whining, tears, and rolling around on the ground. He is really hard on himself! If he doesn't play well, bats are thrown, racquets are scraped along the ground, etc. (Right now, Jim's mom is laughing and saying \"Uh huh! He's Jim's kid all right!) Being a perfectionist is apparently hereditary?!"
"1995" "As mobile networks have evolved, so have the phones that work on those networks. Given the complexity of spectrum allocation plans in countries around the world and the high cost of spectrum, wireless providers have been forced to acquire spectrum where it was available rather than where it was best suited to their needs. When a provider network utilized only one set of frequencies, single band phones were acceptable. Each new set of frequencies acquired by the providers required that the phones be able to operate on the new frequencies in addition to the old frequencies. Consequently, over the past fifteen years, handsets have evolved from single band through dual band and tri band phones to the quad and penta band phones of today. Some of the biggest providers in the world today are already planning for a future with 10-band and 11-band phones."

Their calendars were less a method of calculating days, moons and years, more a way of watching the movement of Creation.

"2011" "Loneliness experienced in all our human glory is a debilitating sense of loss because when we are trying to see ourselves reflected in the eyes of others, we are also trying to love ourselves…. only the love is illusory. That is why when we are not able to be with others we cannot feel the fullness of real love in ourselves. Loneliness is a human abstraction related to the idealisation of a false love, but paradoxically in its real nature is the release of spiritual aloneness. Loneliness experienced from the position of self-awareness is aloneness which opens the mystical doorway into a greater awareness of self, and therefore the ability to love oneself for who one really is."

"2017" "Andrew Weatherall’s remix of ‘Stratus’ is a striking interpretation of the original. Initial momentum is thrust through the track with a heavy and deep bass at the outset. When the driving rhythmic aspects of the track subside somewhat an intricate and compelling electro sound adds a retrospective feel with references to eighties synth music and older production styles using particular patches and effect-laden guitar sweeps etc. to create a layered and affecting track. The percussive scope of the remix is enhanced by the inclusion of Bongos, Djembe etc. supplementing the physicality of the rhythm. As the track draws to an end the sound begins to reveal a darker undertone and more industrial possibilities for the track are alluded to. This remix manages to maintain originality whilst taking a wholly different angle on the track and supplies another unique track."
"2018" "In the mean time the new-dangled polling machines - Which as we SHOULD all know by now are just like standardized tests forms, was a little modern, a little archaic (do I really need that voter stand to make my selections?) couldn't I just sit on the floor off to the side and work it out?"

They won’t blame the other parties standing against them, but for some strange reason they seem to think that UKIP should not oppose them, I don’t know why as we are not the same. They belong to a pro-EU party that has lost its way; we in UKIP are in an anti-EU party that is very focussed, we are not an extension of the Conservative Party, the Labour Party nor any other political party, we are UKIP and are now set on making our mark on British politics, although we will try not to mark the sports all floor."

In that same interview from above, Hunter discussed the subject matter, going into some heady stuff about Dada and transhumanism and “denying our animal selves.” I’m not sure what she meant, and I’m not sure that it matters. This isn’t an album about a specific narrative, it’s about sounds and colors and the way a synth tone or cryptic string of words hits you and makes you feel something. When the guitars are chugging and the drums are crackling and Hunter sings, “When I finally let my guard down, I was in the middle of the sea and drowning,” I don’t know what she means exactly, but it gives me goosebumps.

No sign of trauma or anything amiss in her obs but Aimee must have taken a bath in fairy dust or something guys because her pupils are like dinner plates. She’s off orbiting some alien world, freaking out, yeargh! No idea where she is. Completely suggestible. I asked her if she lived here and she said yes, but no-one knows her of course. No ID. I’d guess she was about twenty or so. Don’t know if I heard her name right, but she seems to respond to it. I think it’s just a case of hospital for safety until she splashes down again. Sorry guys.

Allowing ideas to mix and fold with each other with an eye on the problem space, allows more useful solutions to come to mind. Sharing and discussing ideas is part of the process, also getting the ideas in front of people is critical to knowing if you have something they may want to use. The first idea is not going to be the last one, you will have many ideas. It is important to explore the solution space. Certain themes will follow you. You will find yourself attracted to certain problems and ideas. Teach yourself the skills that help you grow in that domain of knowledge, try out ideas and explore. It will not be an overnight success but will evolve over time, often years. Most companies are not overnight successes. Make sure you know what question are you answering. It never gets easier or less busy, it is a lifetime commitment, so make sure you love what you are doing. It is a good attitude to realize that things change and it helps to be excited by those challenges and alterations from the original course. It helps to think about smaller goals than the end goal. Look to the next hill not the destination."

Senior Juan Blanco leads the way with a blazing 4:19.6 (breaking his own school record), Junior Elias Leija Garza is at 4:32 and super freshman Brian Casillas at 4:37. Throw in a slab of guys in the 4:50 area (Luis Salazar, Alex Blanco, Caleb Buntyn, Steven Rios and Steven Wallace) and the potential for a great 4 x 1600 squad in the post season exists. Getting one of the last group of guys down under 4:40 and the potential is there for a sub 18. Post season EW kids?? With EW's great ability in the sprint relays, the making is definitely there for a blazing distance medley. Would be interesting to see. The talent and coaching is definitely there."

Not to mention the fact that we have free K-12 education for anyone under the age of 21.

I am sure many of us cannot wait to get our hands on a copy as there is a gap in the market for information and design ideas/instruction for this particular method of weaving. Workshop participants had a relaxed, informative and creative day and I am sure individuals left with a wealth of ideas and intentions to continue ‘Peg Loom’ weaving at home. It was most enjoyable"

So encouraging and friendly . . . I had instant friends. Another thank you to TRI California, for beginning their event with a prayer - it really put my mind in the right place. As I waited, the fog lifted and the earlier waves broke up a lot of the kelp . . . so there was a silver lining to waiting. As I waited, I also spotted a seal swimming near the swim course and I said a silent prayer (God, your creatures are beautiful, but please keep them away from me this morning).

That is usually how it works. The fact is that most days I am fine with being appreciated and respected in whatever ways work for my children, but today I would have preferred - preferred - to have been appreciated the way that felt best to me, regardless of how they felt about it. Why? Well, frankly, because I feel like I am entitled to it - not all the time, not even most of the time, and never when I am at my best and most secure - just right here, right now."

I remember when Marsha took me on a botanical tour of the untamed wilderness. She showed me how to open a milkweed pod, but you had to be careful, because they could slam back shut and take off your fingertip. We walked through some golden-rod \"And these are the Ickle Ockle bushes - they move around when you're not watching - LOOK\" And I looked behind me, and, sure enough one had already moved behind me, about to close in, and do - what?
