You may just have to check them out for yourself. What I appreciate the most from Nadia’s classes are her words. Sometimes when people describe things about the body, mind, & spirit it can come off as weird or contrived. Not in Nadia Nia classes. Her verbiage is excellent & fully descriptive for the body, mind & spirit. Nadia is based out of Kailua & I go to her Saturday classes as much as possible. The biggest lesson I’m learning in my body & mind right now is “it’s okay” & “it’s okay to let go.” I’m learning it because of my classes with Nadia."

On and off. My soft, warm blankets suddenly became heavy, like slabs of concrete, falling on me, one after another. My parents were down the hall, watching TV, and the Mac trucks on the show they were watching were suddenly in the hallway, making their way toward my bed to run me over. I screamed for my mom, who came running in, with a worried look on her face. I explained what was going on, and she asked me a most peculiar question: “Who am I?”"

Best case scenario he has switched to a depressed state of his bipolar and the marijuana is making it worse. What can I do? I want to lock him up and never let him out, but I know I can't do that. I am so torn up inside. I know what it feels like to be mentally ill and to not understand mood changes and to want to take something or use something that fixes it. He says smoking weed makes him feel \"normal\" when nothing else does. He says he is afraid of a med change. I don't know what more I can do for him. He sees a psychiatrist for his meds. He sees a therapist weekly. He has been seeing a substance abuse counselor and passed his last UA. I just had a feeling that he might have smoked so I asked him if he was going to pass his next UA and he told me no."
"22" "Why did not Paul and Peter simply demand obedience to Christ as one in authority? Because they knew that Christ saves by means of his death on man’s behalf, not simply by his authority. The authority of Christ can be recognized in obedience with no thought of his death as propitiation…Merely to believe in him as God’s Son with no thought of the cross is not enough. Likewise, to repent with no thought of Christ crucified, and to be baptized, except as a response to his death for our sins, are not enough….In all of his obedience the sinner should know that he is responding to the blood of Christ, not merely recognizing the right of Christ to demand obedience” (The Gist of Romans, 9)"

"37" "We have been very effective in Afghanistan. We have a potent force in the Apache attack helicopters. We are up against intelligent and capable enemies, whether in Afghanistan or Iraq, and we know that they will continue to look for ways to attack land-based vehicles or air-based platforms. We have a lot of measures in place. The hon. Lady will understand that it is not appropriate to discuss all the detail, but where we identify a threat - be it a new or technological threat - we identify a quick way to deal with it. Sometimes that takes time as we come to understand the threat before developing the technical response. Our focus at all times is the protection of our personnel, whether it involves fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, land-based systems or maritime systems.It is thus not as if our fears and concerns were not known in parliament at the time, but as Ann Winterton constantly brought them up in the House, they were just as constantly ignored. Had they been noted and addressed earlier, many lives could have been saved. Why then, we ask, is it only now that we are seeing \"a precise and shocking exposé\" from the Defence Committee, and one which still seems incapable of getting to grips with some of the detail?"

I want to learn more about blogging, and about the blog world, but in my journey I hope to leave a path for those to follow me. My target audience then is the new bloggers to come, but I do not think I am limited to that, I think that good lessons can resonate with even the most experienced blogger. Regardless of your audience you have to reach them somehow, and for how to do that I asked Jay (yet again), and in good old fashion Jay style he didn’t tell me. He did however give me a whole bunch of words to look up on google. Words like Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Google Analytics, Google Juice, Google Webmaster Tools, blog traffic, blog pingback, and “using social media to drive blog traffic.” My research into these topics made the box grow enormously, and I found I was in way over my head. In fact, Jay informed me he attended numerous seminars spanning many days to learn about such topics. I have absolutely no intention of putting together a seminar, or outlining in detail the technicalities of everything I’ve learned. Instead I’ll encourage you to do the same thing I did. Google those words, follow my links, read up on them, and if you one day get the chance; sit in on a webinar or seminar on the topcis. When you are not a professional, it’s best to just point at one (Oh Look! There’s Jay!)."

My husband, a pessimist, didn't think it was possible, and as we labored up the hill, I began to think he might be right. The road curved and twisted and spiraled, and it went up and down. Sometimes the flags looked like they were right around the corner; sometimes it looked as though the road we were on was taking us in the opposite direction. Then, almost an hour after we set out, we turned a corner and saw that we had reached the flags--we were there. And yet there was another road that zig-zagged away, up through the mountains, and I knew that the flags were just the first point of a much longer destination, and that one day we would have to come back and see where that road led."

While one can appreciate a little mindless healthy competition between gaggles of admirably supportive fans, the fur starts to fly far so often between these two groups that it’s impossible not to ignore it. We’re at the point that national news is headlined by stories of letter bombs being posted to members of Celtic FC (designed, as stated, “to cause harm”, as letter bombs generally tend to be), sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with international events of real standing. All this over a sport designed with friendly competition in mind."

And, what's more, they're still open and offering bed and breakfast to the traveller. The street lamps in the High Street have canopies that are reminiscent of the sails from some old square-rigger. There are no less than three war memorials placed in a tiny but beautifully kept garden at the edge of the town. The smart marina, set about with pastel-coloured apartment blocks, is home to a large number of expensive-looking yachts, their halyards slapping against their masts in the stiff breeze.

"157" "This distinction is particularly important to those engaged in biblical theology (Hebrew Bible/Tanak or Jewish/Old Testament and New Testament theology) because the locus of textual meaning is an issue at stake. If historical critical methods of interpretation are the only tools an interpreter uses when engaging the text of the Hebrew Bible (both necessary and sufficient to determine meaning), then it becomes impossible for the Hebrew Bible to function as Scripture that speaks beyond its original audience. Impossible, that is, unless one posits that meaning resides in the author AND that the biblical authors, whomever they may be, intended to speak directly to our day and age as well as their own—and every one that lay in-between (and beyond). For both ancient and modern writers, inspired or otherwise enlightened, language itself precludes this possibility."

We had another potluck at the warehouse and exchaged gifts under the physcadelic pine tree. The greatest gift truely came from above. Joe weaseled us 5 days to record in a church a mile away from our place. Our friends Jess and Josh run a non-profit rock school out of one of the rooms and arranged for us to record in the chapel. It snowed the day after Christmas. The next morning we packed up half of the studio into our van and drove it over to the church. We shoveled out a parking space and loaded in. The studio was set up in an extra room on the second floor. Transporting the tape machine would have messed up it's calibration and broke our backs so we decided to go digital for this session. This was also the quicker and more convenient option. Day one was spent getting the most glorious drum sounds we have ever heard. Tank and his kit were set up in directly in the center of the room. Stained glass windows cast colored light across them. It was dead silent in the church except for the sound of Tank's drums echoing through every room. In another effort to save time and to ressurect a live feeling that could not be found on some of the first sessions's recordings we would track the bass right along with the drums and ditch the click track. For this we used my usual bass set-up; An Acoustic 450 head and a Peavey 2x15 cabinet. We stuck this in a side room to give it a little bit of isolation and also ran a direct line into the computer. It sounded like it always does and we were happy with that."

And in doing so, we finally had time to engage with the very real issues facing the industry – rather than merely administrating a handful of annual get-togethers.

The Weald has a unique combination of the requirements for producing iron that allowed it to become a major iron producing area from pre-Roman times until the Industrial Revolution shifted iron production northwards: iron ore in the sandstone geology, clay to produce bricks for furnaces, streams to power the mills that drove bellows and furnace in the forge; but also extensive woodlands (the name Weald derives from the Old English word for ‘forest’) that provided the necessary charcoal. A variety of species were cut to feed the charcoal kilns (including Ash, Oak and Alder), but because of its abundance and quick regrowth once coppiced, Hazel was a favoured species. The ‘coppice-with-standards‘ method of woodland management, whereby a shrubby understorey, often of Hazel, is cut regularly but on a shorter cycle than the ‘standards’ (e.g. Oak, Ash) that are allowed to grow on to produce timber, is what has given the woodlands of the Weald their character and structure. It should be remembered, however, that much woodland was cleared for agriculture such that what remains is somewhat fragmented."

Then that sweet swoop of a nose that I saw in my first ultrasound picture – it has grown a little, but it looks just like it did the first time I saw him. His mouth is slightly open, revealing a row of straight teeth that match him just right. Hair that is so many colors – brown, red, blonde – crowns his head, laying straight and tidy except where it is not."

Or minimalism linked to Christianity, or frugalism, or environmentalism - using less to leave a smaller footrprint on the world... just fascinating, a total reaction to excessive consumption - it's no surprise that lot of these bloggers are American."

He’s at that age, nearly eighteen, (it must be hormones) when I wish I knew what was going on in his head. I try to talk. Sometimes he doesn’t want to. Sometimes he can’t. Sometimes I can’t shut him up. Sometimes he hates the world. I try not to nag or push too much but I can’t win. I’m a mother, which means on occasions I’m his emotional punch bag. My love is unconditional. He knows that, and that I’ll always be here for him. He tells me he loves me several times every day so I’m luckier than many who have teenage sons."

But there is One who has always known her name... who formed her in her mother's womb. Long before Mei was ours, she was HIS. And she still is. The same God who was her only consistent source of comfort during those 122 days in the hospital in her early life will be with us in Ohio. When I look at the child that Mei is now, there can be no doubt that there is a God who has walked with her, comforted her, healed her and redeemed her in the midst of all her suffering."

And although VOM did not claim to be a church per se, it did profess to be a ministry based on the concept of doing the work of Jesus Christ. However, what I have noticed is that VOM has taken on certain aspects of an overly large corporation, and that being the case, there is always a danger for the those at the top, in leadership, to not receive personal, spiritual accountability and spiritual guidance from godly wise men."
"285" "We can’t talk about this album, without talking about one of the most amazing vocal tracks on of the planet, The Great Gig In The Sky. This is the part where the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end, my whole body shivers and I get goose pimples in my arms and chest. When those first notes start, I start to hum the tune like a natural reaction, I have no control over my vocal chords at this point. My heart starts to beat in the exact rhythm of the piano, my temples twitch, and my fingers tap whatever surface they happen to be on, and all this happens like I’m watching myself being taken over by spirits or something, it’s all involuntary. And then she starts to sing. Suddenly I’m floating away, I’m in a dreamworld of swirls and colours and the music has taken over me in every way possible."

She put her handbag in the large draw of her oak desk. Then she daintily sat down in the wheeled chair in front of her computer, jiggled the mouse to dispel the screen saver showing pictures of women in the Third World, and then pulled up the drafts of the essays that Kendra, Lila and Mitzi had set. Her raised chin and her cheek-length dark straight projected a statuesque look of educated certainty, the kind that is hard won by earning a postgraduate degree in Women’s Studies. She read with confidence, clicked with confidence, evaluated and judged with confidence. After all, she had all the requisite knowledge, skills and values to draw accurate, valid and acceptable conclusions the could seduce like-minded contemporaries in the academic, literary, activist and other elite circles, the people most likely to hold the reins of power necessary to improve the lives of the marginalized and the oppressed, notwithstanding the fact that they had no access to or interest in her theories about them or her proposed solutions to their problems."
"296" "The main question from the media and indeed surrounding any analysis of occupy revealed in the tone of discourse on the subject, is whether it is a legitimate grievance…six months of stay since September would show indicate that it is surely a genuine one. Dyed in the wool capitalists dismissed the protestors as spoiled hippies who were wasting their time, an understandable ploy (‘patting on the head’ as I like to call it) to condescend the youthful spirit of the movement. Wikipedia at least tells me that ‘In 2007 the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the country’s total wealth, and the next 19% owned 50.5%’[1]. It finally felt that the Country, as well as many others, was finally awaking to the reality of greed and may want to pursue policies of universal healthcare, or fair taxes for the rich, for example. The biggest threat to the success and legitimacy of a movement like this was surely for it to be forgotten, to turn stale."
"297" "'Patient, 23, male, looking for the emergency service with extreme difficulty in urination and bleeding by the urethra, with a history of 3 days that had suffered an attack by a fish of the Amazon region known as the candiru that had penetrated into his urethra when he was urinating into the river. Said that tried to hold it, but it was very smooth and seemed to be of small size. On physical examination, the patient was pale with fever, extreme pain to the manipulation of the penis, urinary retention, bleeding the penis and great swelling of scrotum. Referred to the surgical centre, and under anaesthesia, we performed cystoscopy (endoscopy of the urethra and bladder) for diagnosis and documentation of the case. Identified that the fish was of great size occupying the entire anterior urethra and impacted near the urinary sphincter or muscle that controls urine (Probably as live fish tried to penetrate the scrotal bag, explaining the swelling). We open in the perineum and remove it in this way, but we remove it by endoscopy (sic).'"

He was down in Manhattan bringing someone to court (haha, a day in the life) and he stopped in to say hello. He walked in the door of the pub, and all the staff turned and looked. I mean, he is about 6’6” tall, but apparently police in bars in America is very unheard of and uncommon! We quickly stepped outside to chat as not to cause a fuss, haha.

You see the shadow and see the snake strike and the noise makes it almost unbearable to watch but it is perfectly done. Snape is one of my favorite characters and I feel he was done justice in this film but I was impressed at the ending as well. The battle was done well and I am not the biggest fan of action only sequences."

Many friends and new followers are taking this voyage with me and so while there are days when I feel very alone, I know I can always log on to the Internet and find friends who are with me in spirit! For that, I am so thankful – I recognize now how my words touch others and how their words touch me!"
"305" "So now it’s time to apply it to a more substantial dish. Summer is here and summer vegetables are abounding at every market and begging to be eaten. Eggplant, bell peppers, broccoli, summer squash and tomatoes are all incredibly good for you, require little preparation (if any at all, I usually just stand at the counter and eat the entire carton of baby tomatoes) and make a great one dish meal, especially with the addition of a little protein. And here is where the magical peanut butter comes in. When dealing with kids, and even many adults (who are we kidding here), a dish composed entirely of vegetables is not often the most appealing dinner meal. Eureka moment alert: pour a peanut butter based dressing over said vegetables and suddenly it’s a rush for seconds at the dinner table. Another great quality about this dish is that you can easily swap out ingredients for whatever you prefer. I love it with blanched asparagus when the season is right."

Anti-heroines, on the other hand, get rejected as “annoying.” :P I’ve noticed this both with my fiction and several well established authors. Heroines are generally judged harder than heroes.

That the state is sponsoring a site that facilitates secret abortions for underaged girls is disgraceful. If the AIDS Action Committee cannot get Maria Talks to remove the information about judicial end runs around parental rights and cannot separate the money they receive from the state from their funding for the site, the state should pull all funding until they can."

It was an unforgettable meal because of the food, company and experience, but also because on the way there I was pulled over and forced to take a sobriety test. There was not one ounce of booze in my body, I’m just that bad of a driver. Good thing Umami has amazing margaritas.

My son would have made his first sound investment on an asset that was worth double the purchase price. All the relevant documents were submitted to a Bond Consultant, who didn’t foresee any problems with acquiring a 100% loan. The current rental agreement was also submitted as part-and-parcel of the application, --- and just when we were all getting excited, feedback from the banks came rolling in. Every single bank declined the application on reasons of “affordability”."

I learnt that Afghanistan has been more trouble than it's worth for over two millenia. Even Alexander the Great thought it best just to get on the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Frankly, if one or two politicans had visited their own libraries before commiting to war, a lot of lives would have been saved. It opened the world to me and made me realise how marvellous it all is. We are retreating into parochial mindsets already, shutting down libraries will only speed that process up and all our news and knowledge will become the unfiltered rants of the loud and empty voices."

"361" "The green lacy border has been laying around in my craft room for a couple of years. Not sure of the brand. It's glittery and self adhesive but I had a hard time getting all of the intricate pieces to release from the design, so I just let them be. The title is from the Cricut cartridge A Child's Year and I embossed it with the Cuttlebug tiny mosaic folder. I wrapped some funky yarn around the edge of the picture to hide some REALLY BAD stitching that I had attempted but failed at it."
"362" "The Pope is telling us that HE IS God! REMEMBER—NEVER WORSHIP A LEADER. IF YOU WORSHIP A LEADER, YOU THEN NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN DECEIVED! On July 21, 1773, Pope Clement XIV \"forever annulled and extinguished the Jesuit Order.\" France, Spain and Portugal had independently come to realize that the Jesuits were meddling in the affairs of the state and were therefore enemies of the government. The Pope's action was a response to pressure applied by the monarchies. King Joseph of Portugal signed a decree \"by which the Jesuits were denounced as 'traitors, rebels and enemies to the realm...'\" Pope Pius VII in August, 1814, reinstated the Jesuits to all of their former rights and privileges."
"363" "In the end, we had feesh-meister rescue us, ate crepes, and headed home for a MUCH needed shower. I feel so much better now."
"364" "The mayor and his entourage stormed down to Washington begging for aid for his beleagured city, to no avail. Fortunately, former mayor Philip Hone succeeded in persuading the state government to dole out millions in relief. Meanwhile, voters finally approved the construction of the aqueduct in 1836. Within the year New York experienced a burst of rapid reconstruction; the price of New York real estate post-fire soared to outlandish prices."
"365" "Anybody watching in search of war scenes might be surprised by just how much of the film is made up of Ronald Colman fighting his own private battle behind closed doors. Colman stars as Dick Heldar, an artist tormented by unrequited love for a fellow-painter, and struggling to hold on to his failing sight long enough to complete his masterpiece, a portrait of poor Cockney girl Bessie Broke (Ida Lupino). I don’t think the film stands up as well as Beau Geste, but it does have powerful performances by both Colman and Ida Lupino, as well as atmospheric, shadowy black-and-white cinematography by Theodor Sparkuhl, with the pictures flickering in and out of focus as Heldar’s sight fades."

"370" "But you can’t find yourself if you never lose yourself, can you? And I believe that this process of losing and finding isn’t a one-time thing. It’s a cycle. Once you find yourself and settle into the security of that, it is most likely almost time to lose yourself again. That’s how the world works. That’s what keeps us striving. That’s what makes us the drive and goal oriented people that we are."

That's not given to us to know, about ourselves or about anybody else. Be honest and be brave, concentrate, do the best you can, be willing to make mistakes, and I reckon it'll be all right."

Does it mean I can write the book and then design the cover, proofread the bloody thing at least two or three more times, (by this time, wouldn't I hate nearly every word?), and evaluate which company could best 'publish' my book? And then, as if the next book were not calling me back to my computer, then, wouldn't I need to worry about distribution, marketing, and perhaps the most difficult of all -- self-promotion? And not just worry but actually (sigh) treat my writing as a business? When most days I'm thrilled to just keep writing?"

"383" "Later, when I started reading myself, I jumped headlong into the world of fiction. I read countless novels: sometimes as much as three books in one day (people are sometimes skeptical when I tell them I've read thousands of books, but I always assure them that really, I have)! Historical fiction, teen contemporary fiction, mysteries, the supernatural... And of course, always fantasy. Where my interest in other genres has waxed and waned over time, fantasy has remained a constant (if you ever want good recommendations, just ask me. I'll happily geek out about fantasy novels anytime!). I love fiction, and have loved it for many years. The way whole stories, characters, places can become so very real in the pages of a book is just...incredible. I love reading stories."
"384" "American commanders in the Far East command were disappointed in Britain’s failure to invade Burma in the spring of 1944, and in Wingate, they found a champion to their cause. For the Americans, Wingate had done what a much larger army had declined to risk doing."

"386" "The last presentation was held by Jenny ter Horst, a teacher at the Hogeschool of Amsterdam. This presentation was about future cities. She asked us all kind of things: what we liked about our own hometowns, what we didn’t liked and how we thought future cities will look like. Of course we don’t know for sure but by looking at trends and predict how they will look like made us think for a fitting campaign for Amsterdam. For example, we could do something with the ‘green’ trend which is very popular right now and probably will be in the future."

"392" "Suppliers back were very limited; one day I was in NYC at Myron Tobak buying supplies and there was an ad for ancient jewelry making classes in downtown Manhattan called “The Jewelry Workshop & Gallery.” It was run by Fredricka Kulicke and Joseph English. There I learned the ancient techniques of enameling, granulation and chain making. It was a fantastic school. I’ve since read on Ganoskin, in a comment by Fredricka Kulicke, that most people in the US today doing granulation either learned it at her school or at her father’s school (Robert Kulicke) or from a student of those schools."

I thought I was NEVER going to get another one since I left mine out in the sun and then you fixed it and then I did something else to my one they fixed and now it won't turn off and freezes all the time.

"398" "Please, bear with me. This is an unusual time in my life."
"399" "Onto the streets, I found the Bus Stop location to await the bus returning home. It lay off of a grassy lot where no homes were located. I felt alone, and anxious. I stood as nearest to the paved curb as possible without standing in the street. This way, if something happened, I could flag a car for help, or run across to where the school was located. My peace was soon interrupted by loud calls from the window of cars passing by, and I realized I was being called by racial slurs. I stood and prayed for my bus to come. Around about the time when school lets out, I could hear from the distance the sounds and yells of students walking home. As they neared me, I moved towards the curb, silent and looking ahead. Everything was going well. Then, from the distance, the sound of boys, some on bikes yelling “Hey, it’s a nigger!” I tensed, but stood still with rising fears abounding. As they got closer, their taunting and name-calling escalated, and in fear I stepped off the curb into the street. A few stopped when they arrived to where I was, as others walked past me laughing, more witnesses than perpetrators of pain, ridicule and harassment. “Jolly Green Giant, Ho, Ho, Ho” became their taunt of choice. As the voices got nearer of the loudest of the pack, I turned to face them coming and looked straight into their eyes, peaceably, without a word. My prayers were answered as they passed me by still laughing, yet moving onward. I remember thinking about how the nuns told us not to react upon seeing a pack of dogs on the way to school – Stop, do not run. Look past the dogs, don’t let them smell your fear. In this case, I was able to remain calm. Soon thereafter, the bus stopped and I boarded a crowded bus, that soon emptied as it moved out of the strange neighborhood I knew nothing about."

I was honored to have so much positive feedback, and even more delighted that she chose to feature it. Its special to me to be featured on House of Turquoise since it was the very first design blog I ever discovered, and the only one I followed for a long time. I stumbled across Erin's blog about three years ago when I was looking for inspirational kitchen photos. When I got there, I found a lot more than beautiful kitchens, and had so much fun looking through the collection of gorgeous interiors. I knew immediately that Erin had great taste and an incredible eye for good design, and checking in with her blog every morning became just as regular as my morning coffee."

"412" "For all its slow, unsettling ambience, its high-concept approach and its typically controversial mystery-box reveal, The Village is really, at its best, a wounded cry of anguish, a declaration of love and a solemn, beautifully crafted and incredibly moving film about the perseverance of the human spirit, as personified by Ivy Walker; the blind leading the blind."

Let's just say that it wasn't entirely my fault, and that there's a bit of a design flaw in this camera."

They didn’t take too kindly to seeing Peck cast against type as a crotchety old Spanish mercenary.

I have only seen two fights in eight years of clubbing.” She compared this with aggressive pubs when people are drunk and violent fights ensue. It is a response to the betrayal of the needs of our young people by our Christian leaders and has fuelled artificial communities and the illusion of transcendence through drugs."

Sit ups aren’t suitable for postnatal women to do, so stop them immediately if you are, and neither are forceful rotational movements where you twist your torso from right to left.

Bush's more active and realistic approach to protecting American security against the Islamic threat. With the difficult threat from abroad to cope with, Bush had no political capital left with which to take on the big-spending ways of Congress. His only option was to make the existing system work for him rather than against him. If Al Gore had been in charge, the U.S. would probably still have got the prescription drug benefit but with United Nations resolutions being the only measures taken to counter the Islamic threat."

"632" "Keynote Address: “Reincarnation and the Psychonoetic Body in Western Esotericism” This presentation will explore the topic of reincarnation in a historical review extending from Pythagoras to the present. The emphasis of the talk will focus on a variety of theories of reincarnation and the political context within which those theories were developed. He will also address the topic of participatory knowing and the importance of paranormal perceptions as an adjunct to reincarnational theories in western esotericism. Five explicit examples of theories on reincarnation will be presented: Plato, Origen, the Cathars, Jan Baptist van Helmont, and H. Spencer Lewis. Each example will be contextualized by culture and the religious environment to demonstrate issues of contestation or marginalization. Overall, the author’s approach supports reincarnation as a viable theory for post-mortem existence."

"634" "I would like to say a few things about Christians who compromise with evil… A righteous man is a well of life and a blessing in the land… but if he compromises with the wicked, he becomes like a defiled water fountain. He has muddied the water of life. The word “compromise” has a variety of meanings… In a good sense, this word refers to making a settlement of differences in which each side makes concessions… a difference being settled by a mutual agreement or arrangement… In a bad sense, this word refers to conceding to something detrimental… to something that can expose you to danger or bring you into disrepute. Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 6:14-18… “How can Christ and Belial, the devil, have any agreement? What can a believer have together with a nonbeliever? The temple of God cannot have any agreement with idols, and we are the temple of the living God” (NCV)."

At the time, I used primarily an American Heritage Dictionary, though I occasionally dipped into others when I didn’t have my AHD handy. If I had a particularly interesting word I wanted to chase down, I would go to one of the libraries that housed a 20-plus volume of the Oxford English Dictionary, which is generally seen as the authority on English language lexicography. There also happens to be a fascinating book titled The Professor and the Madman that provides a glimpse into how the many citations the OED boasts were compiled, with special attention devoted to one especially colorful (and tragic) contributor."
"641" "Who is John Dee? I’m glad you asked! Now for the bio (ahem): “John Dee (13 July 1527–1608 or 1609) was an English mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, occultist, navigator and consultant to Queen Elizabeth I. He devoted much of his life to the study of alchemy, divination and Hermetic philosophy. In his lifetime Dee amassed one of the largest libraries in England. His high status as a scholar also allowed him to play a role in Elizabethan politics. He served as an occasional adviser and tutor to Elizabeth I and nurtured relationships with her ministers Francis Walsingham and William Cecil.”"

I think I have felt like this for a while, but instead of opening up to someone and explaining how I felt I have kept it to myself thinking that if I didn’t say it, it wasn’t happening and I didn’t feel this way. Well that was a massive mistake on my behalf. Instead of feeling all happy and fine, I now feel worse that what I probably would have done if I had been honest. I have always had a problem with opening up to people and actually saying how I feel. T0 be honest you all will probably think I am just have a good old winge and a moan, probably to get some attention. But I’m not.

I absolutely love skilled copy editing which helps the author say and mean what she means to say. Copy editing is essential. It saves the author from repetitions and other artifacts of revision and rewriting, and it saves the author from her own weaknesses.

"667" "Also, recidivism rates in Texas are already far lower than in other states because we tend to incarcerate more low-risk offenders who were unlikely to commit more serious crimes in the first place. So recidivism reduction could never be as dramatic as what Labbe cites because Texas' overall three-year recidivism rate hovers at about 28%, roughly half the national average. (See this LBB report - large pdf.) When recidivism rates start out so much lower, any reduction will be less significant, by definition."

Hiram Bingham had explored this area in his first visit to Peru in 1909 and had discovered a number of small ruins close to where Vilcabamba would eventually be revealed but thought them to be insignificant and thus ruled them out as a possible site for Vilcabamba. Once he had visited Machu Picchu its magnificence suggested to Bingham that this must in fact be “The Lost City of the Incas”. Savoy’s discovery and later research by the likes of Vincent Lee and John Hemming showed Bingham to be incorrect. What then, exactly, was Machu Picchu?"

We have the look of an unedited telling of what happens to a family when their loving, strong, faithful father and husband is killed in war. It is an eye-opening account of the untold tragedy that war can bring on a family. And how God’s grace can make the difference in the end. Through many dangers, toils and snares, which seem to have the final say day after day and year after year."

It was as if it was 1954, the Castelli Gallery, and Jasper Johns’ first show all over again, a moment where fevered dreams of belief met up with raw material and the physical status of objects, where people started to wonder what one had to do with the other.

"789" "However, Glow doesn’t completely escape the shoe-horned love triangle. For most of the novel, I had wonderful hopes. Waverly and Kieran are presented as a sweet and loving couple, and we actually meet them as Kieran proposes to Waverly. Their love for each other motivates them both through their respective stories—it alternates between the two of them—as Waverly wishes she could just see Kieran one more time and Kieran gets through some pretty horrific stuff by knowing that Waverly wouldn’t want him to give up. You want them to get back to each other as much as they do, because they love each other. Seth, Kieran’s main rival for control aboard the Empyrean, is initially presented as an alternative to Kieran, but both Waverly and Kieran have that thought and dismiss it in the course of the novel. I thought I was home-free! But, of course, at the end, he is cemented into place as the third member of this love triangle. I am tempted to give up and just let the crazy kids these days make their “Team Kieran” and “Team Seth” shirts, since we have apparently decided this is required for a franchise to be successful. But I can’t. If I give up, shoe-horned live triangles will win, and we can’t have that."

Jacob seemed determined to be his own man, whether in his enthusiasm for the West, his decision to leave Wheeler or join Jedediah Smith’s expedition over following his brother Nathan to Texas. And yet . . . he never defended himself in the face of their criticism. Instead, he resorted to resentful silence. Why did he constantly fail to defend himself? Was he merely trying to keep the peace? Or did some small part of him fear that his family may have been right about him? It seemed strange than many fans and critics of “INTO THE WEST” seemed to adore Jacob for his seemingly self-assurance and outgoing personality. At the same time, they derided Jethro for being an insecure loser in their eyes. I got the feeling that they were so busy either scorning Jethro or adulating Jacob that they failed to detect the latter’s personal insecurities and darker traits. And Jacob certainly had them by the bucketful."

Of course, at this time I had no idea what they were. They are climbers, and eventually they took over the entire pergola.

To do this we will literally take the word “joy” and examine it letter by letter.

"983" "Miriam's gift is both fascinating and scary. She can read people after skin-to-skin contact and foresee the date and manner of their death. Wendig brilliantly utilises this idea to jump start the action and to misdirect the reader. I was afraid that it might hobble the immediacy of the narrative in places, as once you know that a character will only die in forty years time from old age, you won't have any anxiety for their safety if they get into bad situations in the story. As Miriam keeps reiterating that one of the rules of her visions is that they can't be changed, you have to believe the visions or the whole foundation of the narrative crumbles. However, Wendig manages to avoid this hobbling effect, by showing us even Miriam has doubts when the situations become desperate enough and while she believes the visions are correct, she can't help but think that this might be the one time she succeeds in changing them. This way there is still a sense of immediacy to the action and there are some edge-of-your-seat moments in the book."
"984" "I took Trout with me up to Chattanooga last Saturday to check out the market they have set up along the Tennessee River to see if I want to participate. I don't. Its way too hard. I was a little worried about taking Trout because she doesn't like little children - and by that i mean three feet tall or less - and she can also get aggressive towards other dogs when she is on a leash. V and I decided to split the dogs up for a while because their pack behavior was bad on Halloween night -they rushed the door anytime someone knocked and we couldnt make them get off or sit or do anything. So I took Trout and he kept Koby and we are working on having them stay seated when the door opens and waiting for a command to go through the door."

In fact the reference to the holy ones in this context does not take place until the “conspicuous horn” arises after the fourth beast, which is Rome.

A woman who has never been beaten by her husband is wasting her time. She will never really know what true love means. It is also really nice to be beaten because my husband always buys me gifts after beating me. I sometimes provoke him to beat me up so that I can have my gifts!

He still had 3 years yet to live, though I intended to cut those short right then and there. I’ll say this for the man, he knew how to fall from a mount. I’d intended to incapacitate him in the fall, but he was back on his feet and drawing his pistol before I’d even regained mine own footing. I snatched the pistol away from him and banished it to the land of Tobol Canash in the Riovet warding. I trust the inhabitants made good use of it. I then deftly grabbed him by the boots and tore them from his feet, sending him sprawling, stocking-footed on the ground. I jumped on the prone man and wrapped my hands around his throat, feeling what little fight he had left fade from his body."

"1025" "My big confession for the day is I was not part of any of the May Day demonstrations, nor did I show much solidarity with the movement. While many other Occupiers went on strike, I went to my job–which is to try and find full time work. While I solidly a member of the 99%, I am also a part of the 8.9% of that 99%–the percentage of Americans nationwide who are unemployed. I’ve been underemployed for almost three years, been on unemployment for more than a year and am still looking for a paying full-time job–which is a full-time job in itself. This is a struggle that while I know I’m not alone in, I am still isolated by it. I’m tired of having to answer the question “why are you having trouble finding work when you have two degrees?” with the phrase “I don’t know.” Part of me wants to tell them to ask the over 1,000 companies that decided to go with someone that was a closer fit for them, because I haven’t got a clue. It’s hard enough to continually answer “why do you want to work here” without feeling desperate. While I know I have friends and a community to help me out, I know I am in this by myself for the most part."

I can certainly respect the filmmaker’s decision to change the line so as not to offend anyone, but I still think it was a funny gag. At least it survives in the trailer."

We need more foster parents, but in addition to that, we need foster parents who are willing to reach out to these birth parents. The children in foster care are only the symptom. We have to treat the cause, otherwise we will never have enough foster parents. Many of these parents are orphans too. Both the birth moms of our 3 foster children were raised in foster care. They aged out of the system, which means that when they turned 18, they were on their own with no help. They have both told me that they didn't know nice foster parents existed. I can only hope and pray that God has put us in their lives and in their children's lives to break the cycle."

It was so nice to enjoy the night together, and not worry about getting back to the kids. The best part was knowing they were having the time of their lives, and not missing us a bit! The next morning we even enjoyed sleeping in (a bit), then John went to work and I enjoyed breakfast with a friend. I went to get the kids about 11, and they were far from ready to go home! I don't know that they were even excited to see me. Gram was spoiling them, and they had an agenda of things to do before going home. We had lunch, pulled a sled behind the 4-wheeler, cut out Cole's pinewood derby car, played some more, and finally headed for home around 3. Drew had a long nap, and we had a fun night. Gram let us borrow Home Alone 3 (they watched 1 AND 2 at their house), which they couldn't wait to see! They were all ready for bed when it was time.

And it was interesting to see how God revealed these errors in me. There are certain things that had happened during my time in El Salvador, that really challenged my trust in not only Him, but also in His appointed leaders over me and my obedience, ultimately to Him. As these trials came, I brought them before the throne and petitioned God. I wrestled once again, but didn’t try to win, rather tried to understand. Through my praying and fasting, the Lord revealed yet another truth."

Payne then returned to Hoboken on Tuesday, July 27, to pick Rogers up and bring her back to New York City.

For a student to demonstrate that he/she understands the material, or for a student to generate a quality product that could stimulate a higher-level discussion or generate further higher-level independent or group work? Both purposes are important, but the second is clearly more valuable. You see, prolonged, focused, creative, independent work is crucial to the development of high-level thinking skills, whether those skills are then applied independently or in a group. But how do we get students with a low attention span to actually do this? Through consistent, scaffolded practice.

Slugging them left and right, and ultimately, fending for himself when danger comes crashing through his window. I found the character immensely entertaining here, but I’m sure, in normal circumstances, he’s portrayed in a more calm, in control, and vile fashion. Wade Williams just delivers an entertaining, personality rich performance that practically makes the whole movie for me."

He said that when we're not eating healthy our bodies can lean more toward an acidic pH level (because pretty much all unhealthy food is on the acidic side of the pH scale) and that can make it so the body holds on to fat. So he recommends that for the first four days on the plan we drink water with fresh squeezed lemon because lemon is surprisingly very alkaline. On day one we're supposed to squeeze one lemon into a glass of water, day two is two lemons, day three is three lemons, and day four is four whole lemons. Just the two lemons today was pretty freaking sour, so I'm thinking that tomorrow and the next day I will just squeeze one lemon into a glass of water and drink that many glasses."

"1254" "But notwithstanding its merits, the approach, at least as I understand it, also presents real challenges and dangers. Its radical localism, its vision of community control of key services, will depend on local capacity which is inevitably uneven, on new funding models not yet fully developed, and on the willingness of communities to take on more responsibilities, which is not assured. Most people are already stretched for time and many may not want to become “service managers”. And, if the state uses these new models to justify deep cuts, localism could easily become compulsory volunteerism or what we usually call offloading. So, for example, voluntary firefighters are important and deserve our respect and support – but they also deserve the best of training and equipment and the support of professionals and they cannot be expected to do the whole job. We know that community health care and social services are important but they cannot do it all. They cannot take on research and science, health surveillance, infrastructure and procurement, redistribution, and the pooling of risk to ensure that everybody is covered for care."

"1272" "I mentioned earlier that Christ’s appearances to His apostles would become less frequent. They would have to learn to carry on His work without Him. Christ appears to all the assembled disciples again eight days later (verse 26). He targets Thomas immediately, asking him to investigate His wounds for himself (verse 27). Note that Thomas is the only one who said he would not only need to see but place his finger in the wounds. Christ is, in effect, saying, ‘Your friends didn’t need to touch Me in order to believe, yet you do. Don’t insist on conducting your own proof, just have faith!’ Thomas was guilty of a) not believing Jesus’s prophecies, b) mistrusting what the disciples told him and c) placing himself above Our Lord by challenging Him. This isn’t too far removed from asking God and His Son for ’signs’ or ‘wonders’. We saw the High Priests do this in Matthew 16:1-12, but some churchgoers and ordained today are also guilty of this. Indeed, the other disciples recognise Thomas’s sin; they are ashamed for him and somewhat discouraged by his open scepticism. Remember, they are still absorbing the significance of what has happened over the past few weeks."

Now that we’ve got that out of the way and I’ve appropriately reduced your expectations it should come as no surprise that The Hunger Games disappoints. I don’t believe the same opinion will be held by the tween audience they aimed the movie at, but I found it lacking in universal appeal. I found the acting to be just ok, with the notable exception of Stanley Tucci’s Caesar Flickerman, which was by far my favourite of the movie. Also, I don’t remember Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) being – as yummy as the guy playing him – the head gamekeeper in book one. Maybe I’m misremembering but I’m pretty sure Crane took over in Catching Fire because the head gamekeeper was made to pay for the fact that the Capital had to crown two victors instead of one…am I wrong? And if they kill off Crane now, then who will be throwing around his influence and the power of his inside position to get Katniss and crew out in the next games? Also, I didn’t see Crane as quite this young; I saw him closer to 40 than 30, but I definitely approve of the choice of Bentley. He doesn’t get nearly enough exposure."

"1287" "In the past year, Dom Fernow (of Prurient and Hospital Records) has unleashed a torrent of cassettes recorded under the alias Vatican Shadow. On these limited-edition tapes, Fernow eschews both the feedback-and-vocal noise of the bulk of his output and the weird, minimal synth confessionals of this year's Prurient full-length, Bermuda Drain. Instead, Vatican Shadow is all about 80s tape noise culture, primitive power electronics and crude synth experiments. It's also some of the best music Fernow has made. The artwork and song titles of these releases make references to contemporary news stories from the War on Terror, a nod to the polemical politics of noise pioneers like Muslimgauze and the shock-value obsession with death and violence that run all through this scene. But the music itself betrays little hint of these obsessions, except in the way it sonically creates a mood of downbeat introspection. Fernow blends martial industrial beats with minimal, hauntingly beautiful synthesizer lines that wouldn't be out of place on a noise tape, a Tangerine Dream album, or a modern drone disc. The result is surprisingly powerful considering the simple elements. The tension between the pulsing, machine-like rhythms and the fragile beauty of the synths, which are sometimes crushed beneath the beats, and sometimes soar above them, provides an aural equivalent of the thematic emphasis on war and contemporary politics. This particular set, a box of four short tapes, is perhaps the best (and the most beat-heavy) of many Vatican Shadow releases from this year, but they're almost uniformly excellent, and thankfully they've all been released digitally to compensate for the scarcity of the physical releases.

He is not the product of a creative writing course or degree in literature and I can't help but wonder if that and his clear connection to nature is fundamental to this novel's success and in some way. The prose is pared back to the bone, its simplicity a stylistic statement in itself, and this helps to make the daily descriptions of the rural life of its protagonist and the Dutch countryside that surrounds him attain a poetic beauty whilst not having any kind of obvious poetic flourishes."

"1423" "Curling follows the claustrophobic and creepy disturbing life of Jean-François that he imposes on his 12-year-old daughter Julyvonne (played by the real-life father-daughter team of Emmanuel and Philomene Bilodeau). We are first exposed to the prison around both our characters when Julyvonne is told she has astigmatism and that she must have realized something was wrong by not seeing the chalkboard at school. It is here we learn she doesn’t attend school. And it is here that her father is brought into the frame and focus is retained on him while Julyvonne, in the center of the image, becomes slightly blurry, offering a wonderful moment of breaking the fourth wall so we can better identify with Julyvonne’s plight while metaphorically visualizing through an astigmatic image the askew view her father nests Julyvonne within. The rest of the film develops this dysfunctional world Jean-François has created for himself and his daughter while other individuals, such as his bosses and co-workers, try to pull him out of his paranoia and open up the world to him and his daughter. The title of the film relates to the brief moments in a curling club where Jean-François finally gets, as Côté puts it in an interview with Jason Anderson in the Fall 2010 issue of Cinemascope, “a spark in his eye”. Curling the movie extends the arguments in the book Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community where Robert D. Putnam describes the decline in ‘social capital’ or the active civil engagement that makes for strong democracies, by having Jean-François working in a bowling alley and later discovering a brighter social world in the heavily lit dome of a curling club. “People ask me,” says Côté in that same interview, “’Why curling?’ Well, first of all, curling is a collective sport, so he could get closer to his community if he would curl.” Côté clutters this cinematic curling house with several stones obstructing Jean-François from making better choices for himself and his daughter, but it’s a different type of curling that finally further feeds the initial spark in Jean-François‘ eyes."

Cameron is a bit shy, but he seems pretty intelligent…and he has an interest in nature. Pat seems like a fun guy…but easily distracted. Kitty and Harper are both very nice. Matt has a cool and collected vibe about him that I appreciate."

In the second, we were told to examine five drawings and figure out which two didn’t belong. The third had to do with spatial relations and gave me an immediate headache.

It’s not the torrential downpours of the southeast where the heavens seem to open from above, gutters overflow in seconds and you are literally soaked to the bone walking from sidewalk to doorstep. That kind of rain makes you begin to fully understand just what a “flash flood” refers to. In Washington it drizzles. There is a moist drip-drop-plop over an extended period of time. Think hours, days, maybe even weeks. The ground never dries out. The moss becomes thick and heavy. And, there is a moldy dampness that lingers from fall through winter and into spring.

"1635" "We've had a number of health issues in our home - mostly the normal childhood illnesses. Danielle was a very healthy baby and toddler. She didn't even get a cold until after she was a year old. As a preschooler, she dealt with a few bouts of Reactive Airway Disease Syndrome and now as a teen has occasional sinus trouble, but over all is fairly healthy. Emily was just the opposite. Her food allergies and asthma brought us quite a few sleepless, worried nights. She also gave us a scare with an inconclusive Cystic Fibrosis test that lead to more tests which neither confirmed nor ruled out CF. That was nearly 10 years ago and since she's never exhibited any symptoms other than the ones that prompted the test in the first place, we've all but forgotten about the abnormal test results. Derek's respiration trouble as a toddler/preschooler likely stemmed from the RSV he contracted at two months. He has a few other issues, but I'm going to touch more on that in another post. Last is my Anna, who like Danielle, is a pretty healthy kid. We did have one big scare with her too - back when she was still nestled in my womb. Because I was the ripe old age of 35, my OB deemed me an \"older expectant mother\" and sent me to the hospital for a special ultrasound that she couldn't do in her office. The radiologist first pointed out that my baby was a girl, and then told us that he found a cyst in her brain. I think that I was supposed to be afraid at that point, but I simply refused to believe that there was anything wrong with my baby. Not even when he mentioned the scary term \"Trisomy 18\" and gave us a very brief description of what that was. Then he zoomed in on her little hand - which was stretched open - and explained that children with Trisomy 18 do the opposite. They clench their hands. That was all I needed. I refused the ammio for personal reasons and instead opted to go back for another ultra sound several weeks later. By then the cyst had disappeared."

But even though He knew, He did not call Judas out and expel him from the group. He knew that Judas’ betrayal was part of the plan and did not try to avoid it. Though we may not know who will betray us as Jesus did, we do know that there will be those in our lives who will treat us badly or speak ill of us because of our faith. Jesus even warned that His followers would be persecuted and hated because of Him. Just as Jesus allowed things to play out and did not try to avoid Judas’ betrayal, we must continue in our faith and in speaking the truth of Jesus even though it may mean persecution and trouble."

A person will spend few days in reading a book; while, in a movie you can complete the story in 3 hours. However, these are like ancient things for me now."

"1738" "With Sir Courtney Terrell, the family succession came to an end, and after a decently prolonged interval, a second (unrelated) dynasty was founded by KE Shelley KC with the 9th edition in 1951. Terrell has continued to be edited in the same chambers ever since—its successive editions serving as a rite of passage for junior barristers eager to demonstrate their worthiness to ascend the silken ladder at 3 New Square, or 6 Pump Court before it. For the rest of us, the same successive editions have seemed (at times) to have offered little more than a handsome and expensive binding for the text of the Patents Act of the day. Readers of past editions will recall countless occasions on which counsel would say: ‘My Lord will find section X of the Act at page Y of Terrell’, with the clear implication that if My Lord were perverse enough to look for section X anywhere else, even in the Queen's Printer's copy, then the text would very probably turn out to be corrupt, if not altogether spurious."

"1754" "Product: This is an oil free gel that’s intended to be a spot treatment for pimples. It is for oily skin beauties but I can’t see why dry skin lovelies can’t use this as well. The aloe vera has moisturizing effects and when I use this my skin isn’t completely dried out. The sales associates at Lush rave about this all the time and they swear by it. I don’t actually swear by this as a spot treatment. I think it helps with time, like most skin care products but I don’t think it’s a miracle healer. I had a horrendous, painful pimple on my chin last week and I put this on for a few days. This didn’t make it go away any faster but it did soothe the pain a bit. I think because of the tea tree. So it’s definitely more soothing than it is a zit zapper in my opinion. I have better spot treatments to make the pimple go away faster BUT one thing I’ve noticed and love about this product is that is helps fade the scars that acne can leave behind with the help of aloe vera, witch hazel and grape juice (which is high in vitamin C which is a natural exfoliator). Whether you pick at it or not, the aftermath of a pimple is usually discoloration where the pimple was and if I do get the urge and start squeezing and picking I put this on and it heals it. It is not a fade gel whatsoever but I don’t notice a super dark mark when I use this. I don’t notice this working on older scars but it might. I just know this does help with fresh scarring. I also like this under my Cosmetic Warrior Fresh Face Mask. I put this all over my face first then apply my mask. Cosmetic Warrior alone is infused with tea tree to help get rid of acne and this adds extra boost, so I do see a bit of a difference in that my skin is more calm and the breakouts dry up a bit faster."

December was a great training month of building/maintaining my base. January was a dreadful month for training, as I came down sick and was un-able to train properly for almost 3 weeks. I ran the First Half February 12th, and still had a terrible head cold. I still managed to finish in sub 2:00, in 1:58:16.

The big entries could have been less heavy, but elsewhere YN-S kept exemplary balance. The consummate flattery he showed in his talk with Hellsberg was also in evidence, with Nézet-Séguin showing that the elusive key to the riches this orchestra is capable of offering is sometimes just a conductor who can smile at them in the right way. The violins played with their signature tone – ‘Wiener heaven from 1911’ – but there was nothing unreconstructed about it and for precision and alertness they gave the Berlin Philharmonic a run for their money. And just when I think I’ve finally fallen out with the Wiener horn, they give us solos as outstanding as the remote call with the octave leap in the first movement’s second subject – truly entfernt, and yet played faultlessly and"

Both thought and emotion are brought to the fore and in combination, granting you an unusual opportunity to come to a better set of ideas concerning your earthly situation.

After he read the quote that had been written behind him in chalk, he asked if anyone had ever heard of Muddy Waters. No one responded, so he went into a brief history of the blues, and eventually he even got a few kids to ask some questions. Somebody asked if Muddy was his real name, and that set off another long story about how musicians sometimes had nicknames and different performing names, turns out Muddys actual name was McKinley Morganfield. Old stories and songs from long ago, the whole thing sounded like they could have known Huckleberry Finn. At thirteen years old, this blues thing didn’t seem too exciting.

"1824" "I have no doubt made the book sound so grim, so perverse and offputting that reading it four times seems only a little less mad than writing it. However Heller, a messy but riotous storyteller in Catch-22, shows control of narrative and voice which makes terrible things into compulsive reading, rather as Thomas Bernhard’s unbroken paragraphs seem initially unwelcoming but propel the reader on. The tension comes from wondering what, among the few events that actually take place in the book (conversations, mostly), will eventually happen. Something does. And if the something is worth waiting for, that’s not to say that the long journey there is a slog. It’s a bizarre delight. Sentence by sentence, Heller peppers the reader with irony, bravery and foolishness, sometimes simultaneously. The telling is technically immaculate: pages of dialogue with multiple counterparties flow faster and faster under the reader’s thumbs. It is structurally brilliant, with Slocum’s story flowing unnoticeably from past to present and from one worry to another – so the reader has no docking points to get off at even if they wanted to. It is a cautionary tale, which offers a compellingly nasty angle on a portion of society and the questions people rarely ask of themselves (“I often wonder what my true nature is. Do I have one?”). It oozes hot grief from the cracks in its tough, cool shell. It chucks a bucket of water over the reader when Slocum is at his most self-pitying: ”It is too late to gather me all up and put me together again.” And when he says, “There are things going on inside me I cannot control and do not admire,” is he a proto-Patrick Bateman, or just like you and me?"

"1827" "In their recently published book, Unmasking the Entrepreneur, Campbell Jones and Andre Spicer offer a new way of looking at the idea of the Entrepreneur, through a range of different philosophical and theoretical perspectives. Many assumptions are made about the Entrepreneur, this elusive character that so many academics have tried to pin down through a set of recognisable characteristics or as a key innovative actor within a capitalist economic system. The value placed on the entrepreneur is echoed in most Western governments through their support of an enterprise culture and of entrepreneurial behaviour across all sectors of life. In this post, I will discuss part of Chapter 3, in which the writers draw on Jacques Lacan‘s work to critique an essentialist view of the entrepreneur. They ask us to consider the idea that the reason why academics have found it difficult to categorise the Entrepreneur, in a definitive way, is not necessarily a failure on the behalf of the researchers but instead, it is because the ‘entrepreneurship discourse does not exist’."

"1832" "Besides checking out the burial sites and the picturesque rice field landscapes the other attraction (and main reason most people visit) in Tana Toraja is to attend a funeral ceremony. The Torajan people are predominately Christian, but the ceremonies are a strong reminder of Aluk Todolo - the religion before the missionaries came. The funerals are large, elaborate ceremonies lasting several days where hundreds of people can attend and need to be fed. The ceremonies are also notorious for their honest-to-goodness animal sacrifices of water buffaloes and pigs."

"1835" "We ran all along Hollywood Boulevard and after the turnaround at mile 7, I noticed that the runners on the other side of the course were running while carrying gallon jugs of water. “LA just can’t get any weirder!” I thought but then as I approached the water stop at mile 8, I realized why… there were no more cups at the water stops. None. So if you wanted any water, you had to stand there while a volunteer POURED the water into your open mouth. In other words, all over your body. (Thank goodness for wicking clothing.)"

"1837" "This unforgettable jingle popped into my mind the other day, and I was surprised to look it up on Wikipedia and find out it has been out of circulation for almost 30 years!

"1838" "Her honest attitude and strait forward speaking were always impressionable."
"1839" "I explained to Jen that I was not throwing her a shower, but we were going to do a spa day instead.

There is that first 15-30 minutes of people joining late, wanted to know where the fleet is, wanting to know if they can catch up. And then there are the rest of us who just want to go go go and get to the destination and what exactly is the destination please and what are we going to do when we get there can we jump already or is the gate red and if it is do I have long enough to run to the store and buy some more beer?"

"1844" "Just yesterday when a bank staff called, I told her my concern, and she was laughing away. I think she got it that she is doing something unnecessary, and this unnecessary job is giving her the salary she wanted. I told her to let me know what is the information provided instead of me giving her the info since I don't know if she is really the bank staff. Furthermore, the bank number is recorded as Private Number. How many times have we heard of scam through phone? I gonna be really careful. I told the bank staff that she might be one that holding the application form, filing up the information I gave through the phone, and apply on behalf of me instead since I don't know how real she is. Therefore, asking her to give me the information instead ensuring that's what I am filing up. Don't it work that way?"
"1845" "As far as the French goes, I do not speak French. That took quite a bit of research. I talked to French speaking people (in France) for some of the words to make sure the right conjugation of a word was used. French words have a LOT of conjugations! Obviously, some of the words we all know, but I decided to list even the common ones in a glossary and use an endnote (footnote in paperback) the first time a word is used. I also knew that some people would love this addition and some would find it odd. I felt it gave a unique flavor to the book and also knew the bohemians were considered odd, so the “oddness” fit. So far, more people have said it was a nice addition than that it was jarring, so that is cool."

It is a fantastic opportunity for me to get on the ground with health and see what’s really going on it our world. So if I’m MIA for a bit it just means I’m in some really cool (and remote) place.

Instead it will remain in communal ownership, although people living on it may in time acquire ‘institutionalised use rights' of uncertain content. Communal land will thus remain in public ownership, while land owned by foreigners who breach new conditions of title will be forfeit to the Government and is likely to end up in state ownership too."

With the Lich King dead, that should free up a whole lot of Scourge up in Northrend – how did Sylvanas put it that time? “Found themselves unemployed”? And say what you want about Sylvanas, but she’s definitely got enough charisma to get those stray Scourge onto our side. Obviously it worked out with the val’kyr, so I don’t know why she couldn’t do the same thing with the vargul or for that matter even all the zombies and geists and abominations. The funny thing is, it’s not even like all those Scourge have been running around loose since the Lich King’s been dead. I don’t know if they just don’t know what to do with themselves now, or if there’s something else going on, but you would think they’d be primed for somebody like Sylvanas to come along and snap them up."
"1870" "As 2009 came to a close, virtually all of Obama’s initiatives were in shambles, not the least of which was his foreign policy and, in particular, his Middle East policy.

You may have seen it pop up in my \"Up Next\" section three or four times, excited to see it, and then get ka-blammed when I did monkfish and oxtail or some sort of organ-related dish instead. Sorry 'bout that. I'm not normally a tease, but I kept losing my mojo about this dish. It's one of the only desserts that absolutely intimidated me, and again, I have no clue why. It's weird, because when you look at all the separate elements of it, it's really not all that difficult. There was just something about the dish as a whole that made me nervous and uneasy about making it, so I procrastinated."

"1908" "There is, of course, one major, overriding problem with this scenario: the zombie horde would almost certainly not develop. Some of the reasons why are already inherent in the flaws of the previous premises. Since zombies would have trouble transmitting the disease efficiently, you really wouldn’t get that many zombies. You’d get them, sure, but in the dozens or possibly scores; almost certainly not in the hundreds or thousands. Those dozens or scores would probably develop in closed quarters where there is a lot of distraction keeping people from noticing the rabid zombie attacks. In particular, I’m thinking nightclubs and bars, wherein the music is loud, the lighting is dim, and the patrons are drunk. Still, there *are* bouncers in such places (usually), and it’s pretty likely any drunk person bitten by a drooling lunatic would *still* wind up at the hospital, but you never know–people are stupid."

"1919" "It also demands persistence, which brings luck. In 1604 Dee complained to James I about an English exiled traitor who in 1592 had slandered him as the ‘Conjuror’ to Elizabeth’s Privy Council. No Dee scholar for three hundred years had been able to find this slander. On yet another late night I was reading a nineteenth-century edition of the ‘Douai Diaries’, documents concerning the former Catholic seminary in northern France. It reprinted words first published by the Jesuit Robert Parsons in 1601. Parsons quoted a letter of 1592 from the English exile Cardinal William Allen, who claimed that in late 1591 Lord Burghley had frightened Elizabeth into changing her policy of ‘not making windows into men’s souls’, and allowing a nation-wide pogrom against English Catholics, because Dee had ‘conjured’ to predict that the Spanish would conquer England in 1592."

Historian Dan Daley wrote, “It was a violent but decisive clash of two social and political cultures, between the past and the future of rural, state, and ultimately the federal government, and a reconfirmation of the deeply ingrained ideal that Americans can assert themselves against tyranny, even when it was taking place in their own backyard.” (This is an interesting look at a bit of American history I’d never heard before.

In order to succeed and win the elections, he flatters these people, rather than saying to them: No, you are sinning against yourselves, against society, and against humanity. This is forbidden.

She took me for a delicious brunch at Teddy's -I had the Rancheros, she had the Strawberry and Blueberry Pancakes- and we talked about her tiny home island in Washington and the perils of deadlines. She also introduced me to Toby's Estate Coffee, a really good coffee place which has recently opened, with a big industrial coffee grinder in the corner and lots of coffee related classic design pieces on display but a joint I think to be taken with a pinch salt as it really is a hipster palace.

"2001" "In an attempt for the boys to become more aware of finances, spending and budgeting I decided to give them a monthly allowance that was not tired to chores. They each receive their age X $0.50 X 4. This gives them $0.50 a week for each year they are old. Of that sum, 10% goes to charity, 30% goes to savings and 60% they get to spend. Now when we go into a store and they want candy, movies, trinkets, or whatever, they have to decide if it is worth spending their own money on (my money was sooooo easy to spend). Also, if they decide to put some of their spending money into savings I will match that amount. This is a concept Kemper gets and takes advantage of but Griffin not so much."

He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks in character, because he is a liar and the father of lies."

"2010" "Life was good, right? Only not for my youngest, my daughter Sara. Almost from the moment she was born, she had A Thing for dogs. As a tiny infant, her eyes widened and her whole body quivered whenever she spied a dog. \"Woof\" was one of her first words. By the time she was a preschooler, she preferred her cousins' threadbare hand-me-down doggy costume to even the sparkliest princess getup, knew the distinguishing characteristics of dozens of dog breeds, and she and her best buddy got in trouble at preschool for only speaking in dog and preferring to consume their graham crackers and milk doggy- style. (By that I mean no hands! And don't do an internet search for that term either!) When Christmas and her birthday rolled around, every year Sara's wish list contained just one item: a real, live dog. If she couldn't have that, then nothing, thank you."

Said was a literary critic by training, and a Palestinian American, and Orientalism remains required reading for anyone interested in Middle Eastern history. In addition, Albert Hourani, a British scholar of Lebanese decent, although not a Muslim, still wrote eloquently about Middle Eastern tradition, and his History of the Arab Peoples is a wonderful read (and the first book on Islamic history I ever read, the summer before I started college)."

I am bemused by how many people like me have an interest in sometimes gory subjects, but found a lot of good blogging and reading material from those who visited my own blog. One blogger, Thelma, even voted my series one of her top 26 favourites of the challenge. Thank you, Thelma. It was a list that included both inspirational blogs and a couple with a theme of death, so quite an eclectic mix in all."

If we were to suddenly require only one meal per day then the people who work in the food industry would surely lose their livelihoods. Again, there is a solution – rather than focusing on the sales of food, restaurants and cafes could set up rooms with special hydroponic lights that the customer could pay to sit in for 15 minutes to absorb different types of light (such as UV or fluorescent lights). The genetic coding of our new mossy skin will be linked in with our sense of taste and smell, so these different wavelengths of light could boast some exotic flavours for the customer during photosynthesis."

Commentator and mystic share an umbral identity.

While I've had plenty of opportunities to travel for work as a photographer, I quickly learned that it's much more fun to travel for pleasure with people I love. In the last few years, I've missed opportunities to travel with my husband because I've had jobs that hired me too far in advance for me to block dates off my calendar, or I wasn't going to be able to take off enough time to make it worth traveling to the other side of the world. When an opportunity came up to spend nearly 8 months of the year traveling the world- I had a big decision to make."

These secrets are so long-buried that even the Historian's daughter Katherine doesn't know them—in fact, to her, Thaddeus Valentine is dear old dad, and enables her to live a life of ease in one of the Upper Tiers of the city. Katherine also has her part in the story, however, and the tension builds as she and Tom make their respective shocking discoveries and realize what they must do to save their beloved London."

But because I had the right conversation, with the right person at the right time, I was given an opportunity with an employer where I worked 15 years earlier.

We spied butterflies on our morning walk to school; and saw a few more flowers opening up to the sun and warmer air. The sensation of being outside is lighter – and that is not only because I left my coat at home, hanging up in the closet. The birdsong and the distant scent of blossoming jasmine has awakened more than just my senses. The higher temperature has brought a swing to my step; and pedestrians are looking up instead of bowing their head against the wind and cold."

In essence, planning is solving future problems before they occur, making decisions, speculating on the future (both far and near), setting objectives (long and short range), considering alternatives, and making choices. Planning for the future requires flexibility to cope with the unexpected. You must set timetables and establish priorities; decide on the methods to be used and the people who will be involved.

But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised: And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me: But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter; (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.

Sam convinces Vilensky to trade him The Boy for the Real Live Girl. He succeeds and jets off, intending to trade The Boy on Venus for the recently deceased King.

Today I and others look around and all we see is division, disunity and battle, individuals so caught up in ego are they that they strive to protect self much more so than people. For many it is party or site, leader or group yet never people, it is perhaps for this reason that I and others have left them to it over the years, realising that amongst the egos nationalism had little play, it seems that big fish in little ponds have always been a curse but the situation is now so very much worse and a movement for change suffers greatly."

"2096" "Basically this means, that new people are joining and staying. Apparently, when anyone joins, the server score is deducted 15 points, then for every minute they stay, the score gets incremented by 1 up to a maximum of 1 hour. The whole system intends to weight itself towards busy, well-run community servers to try and ensure that new players experience the best of TF2. So from that alone, our Server should do well. We have our seeding core of Clan and community players and, as well as new players, when the server is full, we have our more experienced regulars dropping in and out to give them a proper flavour of the game. And we’re seeing regulars who haven’t played for a while, stopping by for a couple of maps, easier now the server is staying full which is a great outcome."

If those bodies are on earth after the resurrection and the holy ones rule from earth forever, how is it then that the body from heaven is EVERLASTING IN the heavens? Both of these words together create a problem I believe for that understanding, because they cannot be everlasting in the heavens if they are everlastingly living on earth."

"2104" "Jason and I aren't really sure how we would have gotten through the past few months without Mom and Joe. They have been amazing and have blessed us beyond words. They stayed with Jordana and Cash while we were in the hospital and took such amazing care of Jordan during that time. She had a really hard time while we were in the hospital because she had never been away from us overnight before, and she was not a big fan of the separation. But Mom knew exactly how to handle Jordana and her anxiety, and she coached us all through that tough time. And lets not forget all of the fabulous meals that Mom prepared for us when we got home from the hospital. Actually Mom started cooking for us before we even had the baby because I was technically supposed to be on bed rest by the end of the pregnancy. But I don't think I cooked a meal for close to 3 weeks after Madi was born. What a blessing! Jason was able to take off 2 weeks for Madi's birth, so he was home for the whole week after bringing her home. But when he went back to work, Mom and Joe would be here bright and early (braving rush hour traffic to get here) to help me in those first few weeks. They have even been cleaning our house for us on Fridays. They are spoiling us beyond belief and I feel like the luckiest daughter-in-law alive! I really don't know what we'd do without them... well, I'd probably have to clean my house a little bit more, that's for sure. They mean so much to us all, and we are so thankful for this time together. We will definitely look back on this time in our lives with such fond memories and remember how they gave of themselves so selflessly. Thank you Mom and Joe for who you are and for being such amazing parents and friends. We love you beyond words!"

Sometimes I would also need to insert another paragraph, so I would put an asterisk or other signs wherever the paragraph needed to be inserted, then write the new paragraph on another piece of paper.

A block later as I turned left, onto our street, I passed Michael’s five-year old sister Sandy at the corner and shouted to her as I passed, “Michael’s been hit by a car!” Climbing the stairs to their front porch I pounded on the open screen door and shouted inside repeating to his parents what I had just told Sandy moments before. His dad rushed out the door and leaped from their porch yelling frantically “Where? Where?” I said “Down the hill on Rittenhouse Street!” I struggled on my bike to keep up with Michael’s father as he ran like a racehorse to his son’s side.
